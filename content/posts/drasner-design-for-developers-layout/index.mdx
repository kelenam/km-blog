## Introduction to Layout & Grids
- Grids bring order to chaos and helps you connect disparate things
- an example: ancient city planning, addresses,
- great for organizational layout
> - helps us comparatmentalize and problem-solve if we think of addressing things one at a time, first layout, then color, then fonts, etc.

## Balance: Symmetry
Having something mirrored and balanced on both sides

Architecture is a great example, investment in symmetry, actually building out products.

Can break symmetry to draw attention to something.

A possible downside of symmetry is that things can get a little boring, nothing to write home about. Sometimes it kind of starts to look really basic.
## Balance: Asymmetry
Not used as much as symmetry because its harder 

- Creating balance in an asmmetrical canvas can be a little bit more tricky, but can be incredibly rewarding if pulled off. More scenes in the natural world are asmmetrical over symmetrical. Great compositions are often asmmetrical...
- Starry Night, The Great Wave, sydney opera hour

- Orizon Design on dribble, has some great examples of using asymmetry to call your attention to specic things.

## Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History
- [**Rule of thirds**]() : Break image into thirds and one key part of the composition goes into one of those thirds.
- [**Triad composition**](): Intentional within compositions, keeps your eye from leaving the canvas, it has your own constantly kind of circling the canvas, tons of examples of this, especially post-Caravaggio.
