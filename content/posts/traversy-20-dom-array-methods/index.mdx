## HTML
1. Setup h1, title of Array methods
2. Next div with class of container, that everything will go in
3. Next will be a sidebar that will contain users/people., we use an aside tag for this
    - In this sidebar will be all our buttons:
    - button with id of add-user and text Add User
    - btn with id of double to Double Money
    - btn id show-millionaires that will Show Only Millionaires 
    - btn id of sort, Sort by Richest 
    - btn id of calculate-wealth that Calculates entire Wealth 
4. Beneath our sidebar we will have a main tag with an id of main
5. Inside main we will have an h2 with strong tag around `Person` then outside of that `Wealth`

That's pretty much it for our HTML, moving on to styling...

## Styles 

1. `*` Box-sizing to border box 
2. `body`:
    - bgc : f4f4f4
    - ff: arial
    - display flex
    - flex dir: column
    - align items center
    - min height 100vh 
    - margin 0
3. `.container `
    - display as flex: this is going to align the main area and the sidebar 
    - padding on entire container of 20px
    - margin 0 (tb), auto (lr)
    - max width to 100%
    - ⭐ regular width to 800px so it doesn't go past 800px when we stretch it out.

4. For the `aside` bar we will just use the `aside` tag to style it  
    - padding 10px 20px
    - width 250px 
    - add border to separate, : border-right: solid 1px solid #111
5. `button`s in the sidebar
    - bgc: fff 
    - brder: solid 1px 111 
    - border radius 5px 
    - cursor: pointer
    - ⭐ display: block (so that each button is on its own line )
    - width 100% of size of the aside 
    - padding 10px
    - margin-bottom: 20px 
    - font-weight: bold 
    - font-size 14px 
6. `main` area using main tag 
    - flex to 1 
    - padding 10px 20px 
7. `h2` 
    - border-bottom: 1px solid #111 
    - padding bottom 10px; 
    - display: flex, what this is going to do is put the strong tag on the same line and allow us to space between, like using table headings without using tables.
    - justify-content: space between 
    - font weight 300, which will apply to the non-strong tag ("Wealth")
    - set the margin a bit for alignment: margin 0 0 20px; 
8. `h3`, is going to be another header we add, with a lot of the same styles as the h2, so we can just copy it, but instead...
    - we'll give it a bgc of #fff 
    - and change margin to 20px 0 0 instead. 
    - and padding to 10px 
9. `.person` class, we will make 
    - display: flex 
    - jc spacebtween 
    - font-size 20px 
    - margin-bottom: 10px

## JavaScript 

## `getRandomUser` and `addData`
1. Select all DOM elements
2. Generate a random user: using the random user API: https://randomuser.me/ 
3. initialize a varble called `data` with `let` that will basically just be where we put all of the people, its going to be an array of people.
4. function to fetch random user. The endpoint we hit to get a random user is just: https://randomuser.me/api
5. We take the the first result of that data and describe a new user object from it using 
6. we use a function called addData to push that new user object into the external data array.

## `updateDom` using `forEach` 
1. call the updateDom function in the end of addData that we will write
2. create updateDom function that will take a parameter called provided data with a default value of the data array.
3. Clear the main div, with `main.innerHTML` = the default h2s we have, Person, Wealth
4. We're going to use the `forEach` method on `providedData`. The arrow function with take a param we'll call item, 
    -⭐ we'll create a brand new element for each of our new people, for that we use `document.createElement('div')` 
    - take that element add the person class to that div
    - add innerHTML to that div and set it to backticks, strong tag with the name, then outside of that strong tag, put the item.money.
    - We still have to append the element to the main area, by using `appendChild` 
5. Separate function to format money, formatMoney, can use a stack overflow 
`(12345.67).toFixed(2).replace(/\d(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, '$&,');  // 12,345.67` and return this in format money.
6. Add event listener for addUserBtn, just going to call getRandomUser on click. 

### `doubleMoney` using `map`  
1. new function called `doubleMoney` that we will put right below, `getRandomUser`
2. We are going to take that global `data` array and map through it, recast into it the mapped double money version of data. 
    >- So we return an object, but first we want to copy everything that is in that user (which at the moment it just name and money, so to do so we use the spread operator what we have in this user object ...user,), so saying `return {...user}` is just going to return what is already there. 
    - Don't forget to call `updateDOM()` at the end of doubleMoney.  
    - do when we want to double money, we just say in that object, `{ ...user, money: user.money * 2}`.

### `sort`
The [`sort()`]() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
- It does so based on string conversions.
```js
const arr = [ 1, 2, 110, 3, 4 , 330];

const sortedArr = arr.sort();

console.log(sortedArr);
// --> [ 1, 110, 2, 3, 330, 4]
```

- If you're trying to sort things numerically you need to use some type of **compare function**.
So to sort the above in a manner we would want we would change it like so...
```js
const arr = [ 1, 2, 110, 3, 4 , 330];

const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
});

console.log(sortedArr);
```
- If we wanted it in ascending order, we would just say `a - b`.
- If we wanted to have this in descending order, we can say `b - a`

### `sortByRichest`
1. Create a new function called `sortByRichest` and create an event listener for this function on the corresponding button.
2. We use the `sort` fuction to sort in descending order, the money property on our existing `data` array.
3. Then we have to called `updateDOM() `

## `filter` 
Going to use the filter Array method, which **creates a new array** with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. 

### `showMilliionares`
1. Below our `sort` function, we can add a `showMilliionares` function, and destructively set the `data` array to the filterered by those whose wealth is greater than 1,000,000. 

## `reduce`
The `reduce()` method executes a **reducer** function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. 

```js 
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
const total = arra.reduce((acc, num) => (acc + num), 0);
```

### `calculateWealth`
1. Create a new function called `calculateWealth` and set up and event handler for the button.
2. In this function, we want to create a varibale called `weatlh` that will be the accumulated value of all the users combined wealth using `reduce`
3. create a new variable that will hold a new div we will be returning after creating it with `createElement('div')`
4. set the `innerHTML` of that newly created `wealthEl`, We will use an h3 with a strong tag, and put in the total wealth.
5. append this new element to main


## Key Insights
Using the `document.createElement('div')` to create new divs, or any element for that matter. If we are using Divs we are set the inner content or text of that newly created div by using `innerHTML`. Then appending the new element as a child of whatever element we want to append it to.

When we are using the destructuring syntax in our `doubleMoney` function...
```ts
function doubleMoney(): void {
    userList = userList.map((user: any): {name: string, money: string} => {
        return { ...user, money: user.money * 2 }
    });
    updateDOM();
}
```
The reason we use destructuring, is that it takes all the existing data from the `user` object we are passing in, all proerties so on and so forth in that object even though at the moment there is only `name` and `money` as properties. If we had more than the properties mentioned they would be inclucded in our destructuring, although since we are using TS, if we wanted to stay explicit about our type declarations we should specify them there. I suppose if we are using TS in this case, as we are above, it might be more explicit to simply just write the above like so...
```ts
function doubleMoney(): void {
    userList = userList.map((user: any): {name: string, money: string} => {
        return { name: user.name , money: user.money * 2 }
    });
    updateDOM();
}
```
