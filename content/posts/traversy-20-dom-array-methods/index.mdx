## HTML
1. Setup h1, title of Array methods
2. Next div with class of container, that everything will go in
3. Next will be a sidebar that will contain users/people., we use an aside tag for this
    - In this sidebar will be all our buttons:
    - button with id of add-user and text Add User
    - btn with id of double to Double Money
    - btn id show-millionaires that will Show Only Millionaires 
    - btn id of sort, Sort by Richest 
    - btn id of calculate-wealth that Calculates entire Wealth 
4. Beneath our sidebar we will have a main tag with an id of main
5. Inside main we will have an h2 with strong tag around `Person` then outside of that `Wealth`

That's pretty much it for our HTML, moving on to styling...

## Styles 

1. `*` Box-sizing to border box 
2. `body`:
    - bgc : f4f4f4
    - ff: arial
    - display flex
    - flex dir: column
    - align items center
    - min height 100vh 
    - margin 0
3. `.container `
    - display as flex: this is going to align the main area and the sidebar 
    - padding on entire container of 20px
    - margin 0 (tb), auto (lr)
    - max width to 100%
    - ⭐ regular width to 800px so it doesn't go past 800px when we stretch it out.

4. For the `aside` bar we will just use the `aside` tag to style it  
    - padding 10px 20px
    - width 250px 
    - add border to separate, : border-right: solid 1px solid #111
5. `button`s in the sidebar
    - bgc: fff 
    - brder: solid 1px 111 
    - border radius 5px 
    - cursor: pointer
    - ⭐ display: block (so that each button is on its own line )
    - width 100% of size of the aside 
    - padding 10px
    - margin-bottom: 20px 
    - font-weight: bold 
    - font-size 14px 
6. `main` area using main tag 
    - flex to 1 
    - padding 10px 20px 
7. `h2` 
    - border-bottom: 1px solid #111 
    - padding bottom 10px; 
    - display: flex, what this is going to do is put the strong tag on the same line and allow us to space between, like using table headings without using tables.
    - justify-content: space between 
    - font weight 300, which will apply to the non-strong tag ("Wealth")
    - set the margin a bit for alignment< margin 0 0 20px; 
8. `h3`, is going to be another header we add, with a lot of the same styles as the h2, so we can just copy it, but instead...
    - we'll give it a bgc of #fff 
    - and change margin to 20px 0 0 instead. 
    - and padding to 10px 
9. `.person` class, we will make 
    - display: flex 
    - jc spacebtween 
    - font-size 20px 
    - margin-bottom: 10px
