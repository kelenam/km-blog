### Overview
Turning JS a dynamically typed language into a statically typed one.

### Dynamic vs Static Typing

JS doesn't force us to write the type of the binding we want to create...
Statically typed languages does.

In dyanamic languages, time checking is performed at run time.

**Pros of Statically typed**:
- self documented (we know what to expect the binding to be), based on its specificity
- less bugs, catch bugs early with compilation stage

**Cons of of Static**:  
- less flexible and fast
- extra layer of complexity, takes time to teach those that dont know.
- Why not write just better tests? (not a substitute for tests)
- Slower dev process, make sure not have any type errors


### Weakly vs Strongly Typed

Weakly: Type coercion, pitfall but there isn't a protection against it
Strongly: Prevents us from doing things like implicit type mixing.

### Static Typing in JS
- Elm
- TypeScript
- ReasonML (based on OCaml) made by FB
- Flow (made by FB)

All these tools are a way to address static typing in JS, they all require a compiler step, Flow uses Babel, all the others use their own compilers.
- flow comes prebuilt in create-react-app

Typescript has it's own compiler, a superset of JS, it adds functionality to JS.
- We write TS code that comipiles code to compile to JS.

ReasonML and ELM are their own languages and don't depend heavily on the direction JS is going.

As developers we need to know what works for our project and team and when to use something and when to not.

### TypeScript Compiler

`npm install -g typescript` for global install. Once we've done that, we can just run the ts compiler command which is simply : `tsc`


### TypeScript 
All we need to do to create a typescript file is the `.ts` filetype...
As an example if we wrote a program with an error, function it will actually transpile it down into ES5 readable code in the new `.js` file it creates. 
In that way, it is doing what Babel does. Transpiling our code. This let's use new features of JavaScript and compile it down into ES5.
```js
const sum = (a : number, b : number) => {
    return a + b;
}
```
Now if we wrote something like `sum(4 + 5)` we'll get an error because two arguments are expected, we will get a different error if we use anything of a type other than a number.
- This is what we mean by catching errors at compile time. This code won't make it to production, because it must first be compiled into JS. 
- Note (that we can still pass in say a string and it will print out in our converted js file, but we will get a TS error thrown in console letting us know about type violations)

### TypeScript 2
- Kind of annoying to run tsc on our files each time, the fix is to initialize our project as a typescript project by simply running : `tsc --init` this will create a config file for us full with configurations for our project. This config file gives us a ton of options to configure our compilation.

To run typescript in watch mode, simply use the command: `tsc fileName.ts --watch` Now it watches for changes on every time we save. 

### TypeScript 3

The first time is a boolean type...
```ts
//boolean
let isCool: boolean = true;

//number
let age: number = 56;

// string
let eyeColor: string = 'brown';
// (detects template strings as well)
let favouriteQuote: string = `I'm not old, I'm only ${age}`; 

// Array
let pets: string[] = ['cat', 'dog', 'pig']; 
let pets2: Array<string> = ['lion', 'dragon', 'lizard'];

// Object
let wizard: object = {
    a: 'John'
}

// null and undefined
let meh: undefined = undefined;
let noo: null = null;
```
- Again, the great thing about TS is that it tells you your mistakes before you even run your code.
- Two ways of declaring arrays in TS, Andrei prefers the second way with `Array<string> = ...`
- remember when specify type to keep it lowercase, because Object !== object. Also keep an eye out for the helpful type syntax highlighting.  
- The power of TS is the new types/features it provides, we'll take a look at those in the next video.

### TypeScript 4

The rest of the these types are types that some other languages formally have, JS doesn't by default, so TS provides them formally as a superset of JS...

```js
//Tuple
let basket: [string, number];
basket = ['basketball', 5]

//Enum
enum Size = { Small = 1, Medium = 2, Large = 3}
let sizeName: string = Size[2];
```
- A tuple is just Array syntax with two types inside of it that can be paired.
- for enum (enumerable), we usually Capitalize the enum name, in this case it's Size.
- The ouput from sizeName is going to be the string `'Medium'`. If I had to describe what's happening, it's as if you are creating a new data structure type, that seems like a custom array that returns the value or property declared in the `enum` by the "index" it's given in it's brackets. A real world use case might be like a shopping card for instance. It also can function in reverse... so long as you specify the right type, you can get the index from the value.
```js
 let sizeName: number = Size.Small;
 //--> 1
```
So when would this be useful? Well `enum`s let's use defined a set of named constants. Useful for specific types of things, like sizes, or directions like up,down, etc. with each value associated with a corresponding meaning.

### TypeScript 5
The next type comes with a warning. You need to be careful when using it.
```js
// Any - !!!!!!!!!! BE CAREFUL
let whatever: any = 'aaaggghhhh noooo!!!!';
// --> Allows this to be whatever without any errors

// void 
let sing = (): void => {
    console.log('lalalalla);
}

// never
let error = (): never => {
    throw Error('ooppps');
}
```
- So what's the point of any? Aren't we using TS for it's types? Yes, by using it you are neglecting all the benefits of using TS for static typing. However, it can be useful if you are converting your JS code into TS code over a long period of time. 
- For functions we can specify `void` if we are not expecting anything to be returned, like the console.log() above we are just use a side-effect. If we were returning something, we can specify the expected type of the return instead of using `void`. 
- `never` looks for two things: (1) the function neither has a return type nor (2) a reachable endpoint. IF we tried using `never` in place of `void` in our sing() function for instance we will get an error, because console.log() runs and then it ends. `never` is looking for an unreachable endpoint so typically used with `Error`.


### TypeScript 6
- interface works really well with objects
- Common practice to make interfaces start with a capital letter, like our emums.
```js
// interface
interface RobotArmy {
    count: number,
    type: string,
    magic: string
}

let fightRobotArmy = (robots: RobotArmy) => {
    console.log('FIGHT!');
}
```
- So what is robots: RobotArmy doing? It's making sure that the parameter we are receiving here is going to have all the properties of RobotArmy we listed, count, type, magic otherwise it will throw an error. This is super useful for React and props. The above would be same as saying: ` let fightRobotArmy = (robots: { count:number, type: string, magic:string }) => { console.log('FIGHT!'); }` But using interface allows us to more elegantly create, well, interfaces for our objects. `RobotArmy` in this way acts as a type, that must follow the conventions of it as a RobotArmy type and follow the properties and interface rules set out in its declaration.]
- You could say `type RobotArmy = {...}` instead, but `type` doesn't create an alias for our RobotArmy name, and it's not as straightforward.

### TypeScript 7

#### Type assertions
type assertions allow you to override a type any way you want. It's telling the compiler you know what you're doing.
```js
// Type Assertion
interface CatArmy {
    count: number,
    type: string,
    magic: string
}

let dog = {} as CatArmy
dog.count
```
- We are telling the compiler, don't worry about `dog` it is a `CatArmy` regardless of the fact that dog doesn't have .count, we are overriding any error that TS will tell me and say, trust me, this dog is a CatArmy. Obviously this is really dangerous and something we need to be careful with.
- Type assertion is another complex topic, here is an additional resource: https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/types/type-assertion.html

#### Optional properties
What happens with optional properties?
Say RobotArmy only sometimes has a magic property? Well that's where the `?` comes into play...;
```js
// interface
interface RobotArmy {
    count: number,
    type: string,
    magic?: string
}
 
```
Now this `?` says, this magic property may, or may not be part of this object.

### TypeScript 8

```ts
// Function
let fightRobotArmy3 = (robots: RobotArmy): void => {
    console.log('FIGHT!');
}

let fightRobotArmy4 = (robots: {count: number, type: string, magic: string}): number => {
    console.log('FIGHT!');
    return 5
}

// Classes
class Animal {
    public sing: string = 'lalala'
    constructor(sound: string) {
        this.sing = sound;
    }

    greet(): string {
        return `Hello ${this.sing}`;
    }
}

let lion = new Animal('RAWWWR');
lion.greet();
```
In the fightRoboyArmy4 example, you can start to see a potential downside to TS, if you're not used to it, it can be pretty verbose and cluttered you can lose track of what is going on in a function. It's an extra layer of complexity.

So in our Animal class, the cool thing here, is that we can set our properties to either `private` or `public` (which is the default)

### TypeScript 9
One last type, it's a new one to TS
```ts
// Union
let confused: string | number = "hello"
```
This union type, let's us say the value can be either of the following things, string or number, they can also be chained any number of times...
```ts
// Union
let confused: string | number | boolean = true
```

### TypeScript 10
In TS, there are several instances where type inferences are used to provide type information where there is not explict mention of a type and adds types for you....

```ts

let x = 4
x = 'hello' 
// --> will give use an error that x is supposed to be a number not a string.
```

### DefinitelyTyped 

How do we use TS with 3rd party libraries?
Well TS lets you use what are called **declaration files** that let you define the shape of code that the file is written in, it's essentially a way to tell TS, hey I'm also using this library, use these types we just made out for you.

####  definitelytyped.org
definitelytyped.org is the definitive place to go to look for typed versions of common libraries, notice the use of @types, like @types/react of these packages.
- this @types/ gives us the declaration file to make sure our TS compiler understands the library's syntax.
- If you look in the declartion file for React for instance, there are a ton of types, but don't be overwhelmed. 
- definitelytyped is a community project that lets us essnetially use most commmon libs as if they were written in TS with their own type validations.
- Again this is adding complexity, more types, so it's a tradeoff.


### Create React App with Typescript
- `npx create-react-app my-app --typescript`
- `npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest`
Then convert our files to tsx files.
Only covert the files where we will use TypeScript
- tsxonfi.json will be generated for us already set up.
