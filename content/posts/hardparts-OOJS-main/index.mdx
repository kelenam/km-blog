Learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript for organizing and scaling your code. You'll learn JavaScriptâ€™s prototypal design and how it works to enable the new ES6 classes under the hood. Understanding #  and classes in JavaScript is crucial for working with most modern frameworks and for those coming from traditional OOP languages.

### The 5 capacities we look for in engineers
1. Analytical problem solving with code
2. Technical communication (can I implement your approach just from your explanation)
3. Engineering best practices and approach (debuggin, code structure, patience, and reference to documentation)
4. Non-technical communication (emphathetic and thoughtful communication)
5. Language and computer science experience

## Introduction
- Makes up a major part of the React design pattern
- Paradigm still widely popular and important

### OOP - an enourmously popular paradigm for structuring complex code
- Easy to add features and funtionality
- Easy for us and other developers to reason about (a clear structure)
- Performant (efficient in terms of memory)

We need to organize our code as it gets more complex so it's nost just an endless series of commands.

Connecting functionality and the bundling it with the data that the functionality is intended to modify.
