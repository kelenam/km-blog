The JS language originally built for browsers. Now because of things like Node, JS can be run in most places, so we refer to where it's being run as the **host environment**.

- A **host environment** provides its own objects and functions additional to the language core.
    - Web browserss give a means to control web pages.
    - Node.js provides server-side features.

## JS in the web browsers

- The root object is called `window`. It has two roles:  
    1. Acts is the global object for JS code. 
    1. It represents the *browser window* and provides methods to control it.  

For instance, here we use it as a global object:
```js
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello");
}

// global functions are methods of the global object:
window.sayHi();
```

And here we use it as a browser window, to see the window height:
```js
alert(window.innerHeight); // inner window height
```

## DOM (Document Object Model)

**Document Object Model**, or **DOM** for short, represents all page content as objects that can be modified.

The document object is the main ‚Äúentry point‚Äù to the page. We can change or create anything on the page using it.

For instance:
```js
// change the background color to red
document.body.style.background = "red";

// change it back after 1 second
setTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = "", 1000);
```

Here we used `document.body.style`, but there‚Äôs much, much more. Properties and methods are described in the specification:

### DOM is not only for browswers
üìù The DOM spec simply explains the structure of a document and provides objects to manipulate it.
- A non-browswer instrument that uses the DOM would be server-side scripts that download HTML pages and process them can also use the DOM. They may only support part of the spec though.

### CSSOM for styling
CSS Rules and stylesheets are structure in a different way than HTML. There is a different spec, [**CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/), that explains how they are represented as objects, and how to read and write them.

- CSSOM is used together with DOM when we modify style rules for the document. In practice, CSSOM is rarely required, becuase usually CSS rules are static.

### BOM (Browser Object Model)
The **Browser Object Model (BOM)** represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.

For instance:
The `navigator` object provides background information about the browser and the operating system. There are many properties, but the two most widely known are: navigator.userAgent ‚Äì about the current browser, and navigator.platform ‚Äì about the platform (can help to differ between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).
The `location` object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.
```js
alert(location.href); // shows current URL
if (confirm("Go to Wikipedia?")) {
  location.href = "https://wikipedia.org"; // redirect the browser to another URL
}
```
Functions `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` are also a part of BOM: they are directly not related to the document, but represent pure browser methods of communicating with the user.

üìù BOM is the part of the general HTML specification.

Yes, you heard that right. The HTML spec at https://html.spec.whatwg.org is not only about the ‚ÄúHTML language‚Äù (tags, attributes), but also covers a bunch of objects, methods and browser-specific DOM extensions. T


## Review Questions
1. What does a **host environment** do with regards to JS, and what do we mean by **host environment**?
1. What does the DOM spec explain?
1. Are the functions `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` apart of the DOM?
1. What is the BOM?
