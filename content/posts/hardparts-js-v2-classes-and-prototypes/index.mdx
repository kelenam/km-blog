## Summary Questions
1. Refresher: what two things are essential to any software development and running code?
2. Why is software development hard?
3. What goals does the Object-oriented paradigm aim to address?

## Class & OOP Introduction

### Classes, Prototypes -- Object Oriented JavaScript
- An enourmously popular paradigm for structuring complex code
- **Prototype chain** - the feature behind-the-scenes that enables emulation of OOP but is a compelling tool in itself
- Understanding the different between `__proto__` and prototype 
- The `new` and `class` keywords as tools to automate our object & method creation

Going to start off by reminding ourselves...

### Core of development (and running code) 
> **1. Save data (e.g. in a quiz game the scores of user1 and user2)**  
> **2. Run code (functions) using that data (e.g. increase user 2's score)**[^1]

Easy! So why is development hard?

In a quiz game I need to save lots of users, but also admins, quiz questions, quiz outcomes, league tables--all have data and associated functionality.

In 100,000 lines of code...  
- Where is the functionality when I need it?
- How do I make sure the functionality is only used on the right data!

>* **That's what makes coding complex, is that there is so much data and so much functionality it only applies to certains bits, and finding that functionality and making sure its applied to the right bits, we need some kind of organizing structure.**[^2]

### That is, I want my code to be:
> **1. Easy to reason about**  
> **2. Easy to add features to (new functionality)**  
> **3. Nevertheless efficient and performant**[^3]

The Object-oriented paradigm aim is to let us achieve these three goals.

## Object Dot Notation

### So if I'm storing each user in my app with their respective data (let's simplify)
| user1 | user2 |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| name:'Tim' | name: 'Stephanie' |
| score: 3 | score: 5 |

And the functionality I need to have for each user (again simplifying!)
- Increment functionality (there'd be a ton of functions in practice)

How could I store my data and functionality together in one place?
