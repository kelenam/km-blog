## Objects default `__proto__`
```js
const obj = {
    num: 3
}

obj.num // --> 3
obj.hasOwnProperty("num") // ? where's this method?

Object.prototype // { hasOwnProperty: FUNCTION }
```
- We have that secrete `__proto__` property on our `obj` object, when we assign our `num` property its in the regular object portion of it, and `__proto__` is technically hidden (but still accessible)

- As soon as any JS runtime starts, it adds in the background, a function/object combo with the label `Object`. It's a function/object. It's actually a function that when called with the `new` keyword is going to return us an object.
- That `Object` as all function/object combos have, has the property `.prototype` which is itself is a big old object.
  - It also has a few different properties within that `prototype` property, like `hasOwnProperty`

A lot of functionality, especially behind-the-scenes stuff that you might know where it's coming from, comes from JS using its own very prototypal nature to give access to a bunch of shared functions.

- Important to remember, that when we set a functions `__proto__ `property it overrides any existing values, but by design, things will ultimately reach back up the chain to a "parent" or a higher `prototype` property (with the exception of Object, whose `__proto__` is `null`)

## Function.prototype and Array.prototype

### Arrays and functions are also objects so they get access to all the functions in Object.prototype but also more goodies
```js
function multiplyBy2(num){
  return num*2;
}
multiplyBy2.toString(); // Where is this method?
Function.prototype // { toString: FUNCTION, call: FUNCTION, bind: FUNCTION }
multiplyBy2.hasOwnProperty("score") // Where is this property?
Function.prototype.__proto__ //--> Object.prototype { hasOwnProperty: FUNCTION }

```
- When JS loads, it also gets another fun
- Important to realize, that we really aren't using the `.prototype` with its big empty object/store on a function/object combo unless we call that function with the `new` keyword, we don't really use it outside of these instances.
- `.toString()` looks at the `prototype` property of `multiplyBy2` can't find it so it looks at `Function.prototype` as the next thing since its the  `__proto__` of `multiplyBy2`.
- we can access `.hasOwnProperty` through the prototype chain, since it won't find it on `multiplyBy2`, won't find it on `Function.prototype`, so it looks up to `Object.prototype`, where it will be found.
