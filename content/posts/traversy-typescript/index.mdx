## What is TypeScript 
- Superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft
- Inherits and extends features of JS
- Compiles/trans-compiles to plain JS
- Easily integrated into JS projects
- designed for development of large applications

## What does TypeScript Offer?
- Static Type Checking
    - JS is untyped/don't have to specific types, 
- Class Based Objects
- Modularity
- ES6 Features
- Syntax closer to other high level languages like Scala or JavaScript

### Static Type Checking
With TypeScript we can check and assign variable, parameter and function types.
- It is completely optional
- helpds us find and prvent bugs and stop future issues from happening
- makes our code much more readable and descriptive 

## TypeScript Types 
- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Array`
- `Any`: Any kind of type 
- `Void`: no type returned 
- `Null`
- `Tuple`: An array with a fixed number of elements
- `Enum` : Enumerated values
- `Generics`: specify the type of constraint, great for reusable code

## Class Based Objects
- Object Oriented Programmign in JS!
- No Prototypes
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance (subclassing)
- Modifiers (protected, private, public)

## TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
- Written in TypeScript itself
- Compiles `.ts` files to `.js`
- Installed as an NPM package (Node.js)
- Supports ES6 syntax 

## Let's get started

### Strings 
```ts:title=types.ts
console.log('Hello from ts');
```

The command to compile typescript to js is this...
`$ tsc.ts [filename]`

- The `.js` file is the want you'd want to include in your project for dist usage.
- Only want to touch the `ts` file.

```ts:title=types.ts

let myString: string;

myString = "Hello World!";
console.log(myString);
```

### watch mode 
> it can get to be a pain, compiling each time, instead run with `-w` flag to watch the file for saved changed.
> `tsc filename.ts -w`

### booleans

```ts:title=types.ts
let myString: string;
let myNum: number;
let myBool: boolean; 
myString = 'Hello'.slice(0,3);
myNum = 22;
myBool = false;
 

console.log(myString);
```
- For nums: expressions, hex, negative, are all considered numbers
- for strings: concat strings work, even String methods work on it, e.g. `'Hello'.slice(0,3);`

### any 
```ts:title=types.ts
let myString: string;
let myNum: number;
let myBool: boolean;
let myVar: any;

myString = 'Hello'.slice(0,3);
myNum = 22;
myBool = false;
myVar = 5;

console.log(myString);
```
-`any` can be of any type

### Arrays
There are two ways to define arrays types...
```ts:title=types.ts
let myString: string;
let myNum: number;
let myBool: boolean;
let myVar: any;

let strArr: string[];
let numArr: number[];

myString = 'Hello'.slice(0,3);
myNum = 22;
myBool = false;
myVar = 5;

myArr = [1,2,3]
console.log(numArr);
```

- `let strArr: string[];` is saying this has to be an array of strings.
- The other way to define arrays, can be be like this `let strArr: Array<string>` 
    - where we use the type name, `Array` and then following by angles brackets with the type inside

### tuple 
Next we are going to look at tuples, where we have to match type to the inputs.
```ts:title=types.ts
let strNumTuple: [string, number];

strNumTuple = ['Hello', 4];
```
-  Tuples have to match the number of elements and the type specified

### void, undefined, null 
```ts:title=types.ts
let myString: string;
let myNum: number;
let myBool: boolean;
let myVar: any;
let strNumTuple: [string, number];
let myVoid: void = null; 

let strArr: string[];
let numArr: number[];

myString = 'Hello'.slice(0,3);
myNum = 22;
myBool = false;
myVar = 5;
myArr = [1,2,3]

let myVoid: void = null;
let myNull: null = null;
let myUndefined: undefined = undefined; 

strNumTuple = ['Hello', 4];
console.log(strNumTuple);
```
- we can set the type and the value on the same line like this `let myString: string = 'this is a string';`
- `void` accepts `null` and `undefined` as types.
- but there are also `null` and `undefined`, which also accept each others undefined and null values. 


## functions
Let's create a new file called `functions.ts`...
```ts:title=functions.ts 
function getSum(num1: number, num2: number):num  {
    return num1+num2;
}
```
- Going to be a simple function that gets sum of two numbers.
> For functions we can add types to the functions parameter and return type.
> we just add the return type of our function following parameters like `:type`

```ts:title=functions.ts 
function getSum(num1: any, num2: number):num  {
    if (typeof num1 === 'string') {
        num1 = parseInt(num1);
    }
    if (typeof num2 === 'string') {
        num2 = parseInt(num2);
    }
    return num1+num2;
}

function getName(firstName:string, lastName?:string):string {
    if(lastName == undefined) {
        return firstName;
    }
    return firstName+' '+lastName;
}
```
> We can use the `?` to make a parameter value optional, e.g. `lastName?:string`
```ts:title=functions.ts 
function getSum(num1: any, num2: number):num  {
    if (typeof num1 === 'string') {
        num1 = parseInt(num1);
    }
    if (typeof num2 === 'string') {
        num2 = parseInt(num2);
    }
    return num1+num2;
}

function getName(firstName:string, lastName?:string):string {
    if(lastName == undefined) {
        return firstName;
    }
    return firstName+' '+lastName;
}

fucntion myVoid(): void {
    return 3;
}
// --> This would err as 3 is not assignable to type void
```

### interfaces 
```ts:title=intefaces.ts
function showTodo(todo: { title: string, text: string}) {
    console.log(todo.title+': '+todo.text);
}
let myTodo = {title: 'Trash', text: 'take out trash'};
showTodo(myTodo);
``` 

Let's create an interface from this instead...
```ts:title=intefaces.ts
interface Todo {
    title: string;
    text: string;
}

function showTodo(todo: Todo) {
    console.log(todo.title+': '+todo.text)
}
let myTodo = {title: 'Trash', text: 'take out trash'};
showTodo(myTodo);
``` 
> - interfaces are basically letting us create our own type, 

### Classes 
```ts:title=intefaces.ts
class User {     
    public name: string;
    public email: string;
    public age: number;

    constructor(name: string, email: string, age: number) {

        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        this.age = age;

        console.log('User created: '+this.name);
    }
    public register():any {
        console.log(this.name+ ' is now regsitered');
    }
} 

let Jon = new User('Jon Doe', 'jdoe@gmail.com', 23);

Jon.register();

``` 
- classes can have properties and methods (functoins inside of the class)
- Inside of classes you have something called a **constructor**, its a special type of method that runs when you instantiate with this class, when you create a User this is going to run.

> We can make it so that we our properties can't be accessed outside of our class using an [**access modifier**]()...

- `private` will make it so the specified properties are private and only accessible within class 'User'
- `public`: will allow this to work
- `protected` means we can't access it from outside of the class but we can access it from any class that inherits this one...
- methods can be made private/public as well.


### Inheritance 
```ts:title=intefaces.ts
interface UserInterface {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    age: number;
    register();
    payInvoice();
}

class User implements UserInterface{     
    public name: string;
    public email: string;
    public age: number;

    constructor(name: string, email: string, age: number) {

        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        this.age = age;

        console.log('User created: '+this.name);
    }
    public register():any {
        console.log(this.name+ ' is now regsitered');
    }
    payInvoice() { 
        console.log(this.name+ ' paid invoice.');
    }
} 

let Jon = new User('Jon Doe', 'jdoe@gmail.com', 23);

class Member extends User {
    id: number;

    constructor(id: number, name: string, email: string, age: number) {
        super(name, email, age)
        this.id = id;
    }
    payInvoice() {
        super.payInvoice();
    }
}


let mike: User = new Member(1,'Mike Smith', 'mikesmith@gmail.com', 23);
mike.payInvoice();
``` 
- We can also write an interface for this class as well.

## Key Insights
- I'm not a bit unclear about interfaces, and using them with classes.... 
https://johnpapa.net/typescriptpost3/
> Why we need a interface that match 1 on 1 with the class? :/
> for decoupling your class from the caller, it allows you, for example, to unit test it by mocking the dependencies. It also allows you to change behavior of the implemnted class so you don't have to change the caller

- Also, protected methods, can be used by a subclass, however, they can't be used by an instance of that subclass.
- I'm also a bit unclear as to why we can't set the type of the properties directly in the constructor, like...
`this.name: string = name`

> TypeScript interfaces are very handy for defining contracts within our code. We can use it to designate types of variables and function parameters. They let us know what properties a variable can take on, and whether theyâ€™re required, optional, or read-only. We can define interfaces with the interfaces keyword, optional properties with the question mark after a variable name, and the readonly keyword for read-only properties. [source](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/introduction-to-typescript-interfaces-85303aede25d) 

I think with the above, interfaces make a lot of sense, stil, using them with classes
