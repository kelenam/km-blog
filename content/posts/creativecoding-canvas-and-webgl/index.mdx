## What is creative coding?
- using code to create something expressive, rather than functional
- we will be focusing on print and web 

## What is generative art?
- artworks creatied in part by an autonomous or rule-based system
    - feeding rules and instructions to machines to generate something

## Inspirations of MD
- Zac Lieberman 
- Anders Hoff
- Active Theory (commercial products)
- Nervous System (creating products with code)

## Other things 
- Physical installations
- interactive experiences
- commercial works (active theory)

## Setup & Guidebook

## Cheat Sheet

Here you will find some 'recipes' and patterns that you can use in creative coding and generative art.

### New Array
---- 
You can use `Array.from(new Array(count))` to create a dense array at a fixed size. For example, to generate an array of 20 random numbers:
```js
const count = 20;
const randoms = Array.from(new Array(count)).map(() => Math.random());
```

### Array with values `0...1` (inclusive)
----
Using `index / (listLength - 1)`, you can get a `t` value between `0` and `1`.

Example:
```js
const count = 20;
const values = Array.from(new Array(count)).map((_, i) => {
  const t = i / (count - 1);
  // Do something with the 't' param...
  return t;
});
```
To guard against a `count` of <= 1:
```js
const count = 20;
const values = Array.from(new Array(count)).map((_, i) => {
  const t = count <= 1 ? 0 : (i / (count - 1));
  return t;
});
```

### Grids & UV Coordinates
----
During the workshop, when I say "[**UV coordinates**]()" I am referring to coordinates that vary from (`0, 0)` (top left) to (`1, 1`) (bottom right).

For example, to create a UV grid with nested for loops:
```js
const count = 5;
const points = [];
for (let x = 0; x < count; x++) {
  for (let y = 0; y < count; y++) {
    const u = count <= 1 ? 0.5 : (x / (count - 1));
    const v = count <= 1 ? 0.5 : (y / (count - 1));
    points.push([ u, v ]);
  }
}
```

### Padding with Margins using Linear Interpolation
---
If you have **UV coordinates** for a surface between (`0, 0`) (top left) and (`1, 1`) (bottom right), you can use linear interpolation to get back pixel values for each coordinate:
```js
const { lerp } = require('canvas-sketch-util/math');

// ...

const x = lerp(minX, maxX, u);
const y = lerp(minY, maxY, v);
```
Let's say you want a margin of `20px` in your [ `width`, `height` ] artwork, you can do this:
```
const margin = 20;
const x = lerp(margin, width - margin, u);
const y = lerp(margin, height - margin, v);
```

### Noise from UV Coordinates
---
If you have UV coordinates between `0..1`, you can get back a simplex noise signal from those coordinates that smoothly varies between `-1...1`.
```js
const random = require('canvas-sketch-util/random');

const frequency = 1;
const amplitude = 1;

const n = amplitude * random.noise2D(u * frequency, v * frequency);
```
The frequency changes how chaotic the noise signal will be, and the amplitude can be used to scale the value to something smaller or larger than -1..1 range.

### Animated Noise
---
By using a higher dimension noise function, you can animate the noise by a `{ time }` or `{ playhead }` variable from `canvas-sketch` props.
```js
const settings = {
  // Enable animation & time props
  animate: true
};

canvasSketch(() => {
  return ({ context, time }) => {
    const frequency = 1;
    const amplitude = 1;

    // Use 3D instead of 2D noise
    const n = amplitude * random.noise3D(u * frequency, v * frequency, time);
  };
}, settings);
```

### `0..1` to `-1...1`
---- 
If `t` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and you want to map it to -1 to 1 (inclusive), you can use this:
```js
const n = t * 2 - 1;
```

### `-1..1` to `0...1`
If t is between -1 and 1 (inclusive) and you want to map it to 0 to 1 (inclusive), you can use this:
```js
const n = t * 0.5 + 0.5;
```
### Mapping One Range of Numbers to Another
---
You can also use the `mapRange` function in `canvas-sketch-util`/`math` to map one range of values to another:
```js
const { mapRange } = require('canvas-sketch-util/math');

// Our input lies between -1..1
const value = -0.25;

// Map the input range -1..1 to the output range 25..50
const n = mapRange(value, -1, 1, 25, 50);
```
This is equivalent to:
```js
const { inverseLerp, lerp } = require('canvas-sketch-util/math');

// Get a 0..1 represenation of the value within the given range
const t = inverseLerp(-1, 1, value);

// Now interpolate that to our output range of 25..50
const n = lerp(25, 50, t);
```

### Fill a Circle in Canvas 2D
--- 
```js
context.beginPath();
context.arc(x, y, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);
context.fill();
```

### Rotating Shapes in Canvas 2D
----
If you'd like to draw a shape rotated from its centre point, you need to first translate to the point you wish to draw the shape, then rotate, then offset by the center point of the shape. For example:
```js
// Draw a rotated rectangle
const x = 25;
const y = 50;
const rectWidth = 100;
const rectHeight = 30;
const rotation = Math.PI / 4;

context.save();
context.translate(x, y);
context.rotate(rotation);
context.translate(-rectWidth / 2, -rectHeight / 2);
context.fillRect(0, 0, rectWidth, rectHeight);
context.restore();
```
