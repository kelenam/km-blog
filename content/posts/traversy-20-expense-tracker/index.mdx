## HTML 

## Style 
- bd for border 
- `trf` transform,
- `trf:t` for transform: translate 
- transition doesn't seem to have an emmet shortcut

## JavaScript 
- Create variables by getting id of 
  - balance
  - money plus 
  - money minus 
  - list 
  - form
  - text
  - amount 

We set a const for localStorageTranctions fetched from loca storage, a let for transactions

I just the following code...
```js 

const localStorageTransactions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('transactions'));

// let transactions: any = localStorage.getItem('transactions') !== null 
// ? localStorageTransactions : [];
let transactions: any = localStorageTransactions !== null ? 
                              localStorageTransactions : [];
```

- Going to have a function for addTransaction, remember this is fired on a submit, so we need to prevent default.
  - pushes transaction to array 
  - addTransactionDOM(transaction)
  - updateValues()
  - updateLocalStorage();
  - clears text fields
- function to generateId
- addTransactionDOM 
  - deals with plus and minus signs 
     - styling 
  - creates new html element and its html 
  - appends new element to list 
- updateValues 
  - defines total, income, expense using HOF 
  - sets the correspond html values
- removeTransaction
  - filters list 
  - updateLocalStorage()
  - init()
- updateLocalStorage
  - sets local storage with transactions array 
- init 
  - clears innerHTML of list 
  - iterates over transactoins then calls addTransactionDOM for each transacdtion 
  - updateValues();
- event listener for submit on form.

## Recreation Questions 
These are questions, when trying to recreate this app from memory.

### First Attempt 
1. h1 or h2? does it matter? Everything wrapped in a container?  
  - A. Yes, all wrapped in a container, you could have guessed by the column-like alignment of all items
  - A. h4 actually, an h1 is used for the total amount balance. 

- I'm finding myself getting caught up in trying to remember the ids used.
