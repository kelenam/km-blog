### Preface
- Based off "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman
- introduces core programmatic concepts not beholden to any specific language
- OG text used Scheme, here the adaptation uses JS (specifically the source langs/subsets of js)

> More precisely, this adaptation uses five tiny, carefully designed, sublanguages of JavaScript. The languages are called *Source §1*, *Source §2*, *Source §3*, *Source §4* and *Source §5*, corresponding to the respective chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the textbook. The Source §1 language contains only constructs that are needed in the programs contained in chapter 1: constructs required to build abstractions with functions. Source §2 is a superset of Source §1; adding features required to build abstractions with data, on top of the features of Source §1. Similarly, Source §3, 4 and 5 extend the previous language features required to address the subject of the respective textbook chapter. All these languages are sub-languages of JavaScript; any Source program is also a JavaScript program. The reverse is not true. The JavaScript language has many features that are not covered in this textbook. Indeed, the Source languages are so small that they can be quite adequately described in a few pages of text. The online folder [source](https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/source/) contains the specifications of the Source languages, as reference for the reader.

- Source Adacemy is the web-based programming env that will obligate readers to not use any constructures beyond the source langs.
