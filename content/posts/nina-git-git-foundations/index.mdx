[Watch the Course here](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/).

 Observation: To get the most out of this workshop I would highly recommend that you go through the exercises. The lectures are great for context and the slides are handy references, but a bulk of understanding through this course comes from reading and doing the exercises.

## Resources

All of the resources you need for class are located in this repository.

### Slides
The PDF of the slides is in the `presentation` folder.

### Exercises
are in the `exercises` folder. The exercises will instruct you to clone an additional repository that is set up for completing the included exercises.


## Description

By coding along with us in this workshop you’ll:

 - Learn how git represents commits and branches internally to gain deep insights into how git works under the hood…
 - Discover the power of rebasing in git, along with how to avoid common pitfalls. Learn to tell when it’s appropriate to re-write history…
 - Discover how git hooks can make your life easier by running analysis on your code before you commit in order to prevent common errors from making their way into your codebase…
 - Discover lesser-known features of git that will save you hours of time when resolving merge conflicts and track down bugs…
 - Learn how to harness the power of the GitHub API to fetch information about your repositories.

## Course Agenda
### Class Overview - Part 1
- What is Git? 
- Working Area, Staging Area, Repository

### Why Use the Command Line?
- CLI much better for learning what is happening under the hood, use tools as they were designed not GUIs

## Data Storage

### How does Git Store Information?
- At its core, Git is like a key value store.
    - The **Value** = **data**
    - The **Key** = **Hash of the Data**
- You can use the key to retrieve the content.

### The Key - SHA1
- It is a cryptographic hash function
- Given a piece of data, it produces a 40-digit hexadecimal number
- This value should always be the same if the given input is the same.
- Sometimes system like this is called a _content addressable system_ and that's because you can also use the content to generate the key.

## Git Blobs and Trees
The way that Git stores things is as _Git Objects_ and a very basic one is called a Blob...

### The Value - Blob
- Git stores the _compressed_ data in a blob, along with metadata in a header:
    - the identifier blob
    - the size of the content
    - the \0 delimiter (string terminator in C)
    - content

### Under the Hood - Git Hash - Object
Asking Git for the SHA1 of contents:
- The way that Git does this under the hood is with a plumbing command:
    ``` [...] git hash-object ---stdin```
- If you run the hash method on the same object twice you will always get the same result.
    - blobs usually unique in Git
    - Likelyhood of collision very small

### Where Does Git Store its Data?
- In the .git directory when we init
    - This in turn contains all of the data about our repository

### Where are the Blobs Stored?
- If you tree command in the .git dir. You can see 
    - Objects
         - (Starts with 8a) (Directory is first two characters of hash)
            - file is the rest of the hash

### We Need Something Else
The blob is missing information
- Filenames
- directory stuctures

Git stores this information in a **tree**.

### Tree
A **tree** contains pointers (using SHA1) 
- to blobs
- also to other trees
    - So why to other trees? It's because subdirectories can be nested.

#### Trees also contain metadata
- **type** of pointer (blob or tree)
- **filename** or directory name
- mode (executable file, symbolic link,...)
- git doesn't store empty directories; it's a limitation in the staging area which only keeps track of files

Trees and Blobs are a _directed graph_.

### Identical Content is Only Stored Once
Remember how content informs the SHA. Well running that hash on the same content will always return the same SHA. 
> In Git identitcal content is only stored once. Pointers will point to any repeated content.
> One of the most critcal features of Git, how Git saves as ton of space. So if we commit a blob or the tree, if it hasn't changed, we're just gonna point to the same copy. Which is why checking out branches in git is super fast.

![git pointers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5563119/63214169-a3c3fa00-c0c9-11e9-9d93-660929d6b0db.png)
What is the difference between the blob and the SHA that refers to it?

>  The difference between the blob and the SHA. Is that the blob is the content and the SHA is essentially the key for that piece of content. However, the key is stored within that blob that tells it what content to associate itself with. (I may be misunderstanding this last point.)

### Other Optimizations - Packfiles, Deltas
- Git objects are compressed
- As files change, their contents remain mostly similar (echoes how we write code iteratively)
- Git optimizes for this by compressing these files together, into a **Packfile**
- The **Packfile** stores the object, and **"deltas"**, or the differences between one version of the file and the next.

- Packfiles are generated when:
    - You have too many objects, during garbage collection, or during a push to a remote.

## Git Commits
A commit points to a tree, and it contains some other metadata.
### Commit Object
a **commit** points to:
- a tree

and contains metadata:
- author and committer
- date
- message
- parent commit (one or more)

_The SHA1 of the commit is the hash of all this information._

### Commits Point to Parent Commits and Trees
The tree is a snapshot of the repository staging area looked like at the time of the commit. 
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5563119/63529626-cf742500-c4b9-11e9-8cd9-552de4df9735.png)

A commit is a code snapshot. It's a combination of the changes from the staging area on the previous commit. 

### Commits Under the Hood - Make a Commit
- When we first make a commit, that first status line we see (e.g. adf0e13) is hash of what that initial commit is.
- if you try to cat one of these git objects, you will get nothing back because these are binary objects, they are compressed. If you want to look at them, you need to use another plumbing command (type) and (print)

#### git cat-file -t (type) and -p(print the contents)
If we are wanting to look at some of the other git objects and their contents we can use the -t and -p flags on the hash identifier.
An example would be: "git catf-file t 980a0

You could do the same with trees which would print out: the mode (a reference number for its type), the blob stored, and the file that it points to. 

You can also do it on commits. Commits again are just git objects.

### Why Can't We "Change" Commits? 
- If you can change any data about the commit, the commit will have a new SHA1 hash.
- Even if the files don't change, the created date will.
- A great incidental security feature, because tampering with commit history would be very obvious. It's also helpful for us as devs because we can expect exactly the same data as when it was commited.

### References - Pointers to Commits
**References are just pointers to commits**
- Tags
- Branches
- HEAD - a (special type of) pointer; it points to the current commit

The reason changing branches is so fast in Git is, it's not pulling down new data, all it's doing is _changing a pointer_.

### References - Under the Hood
If we run the following command in terminal...

```| tree .git```

In terminal you should see the tree..
- `.git`
    - `HEAD`
    - `refs`
        - `heads`
            - `master`
        - `tags`

 If we look in our git directory, there are two important places where these files are stored, the first is called HEAD in .git and the other is in `refs/heads`.

:star: refs/heads is where all your branches live

```git log --oneline``` Is a handy tool to get the oneliner version of out git history.

if we `cat .git/refs/heads/master` we are going to get back a pointer to the SHA of the head

 `/refs/heads/master` contains which commit the branch point to 

 If we checkout the contents of `.git/HEAD`, we'll see that HEAD, our current branch pointer is also pointing to master, and master is pointing to the last commit, so HEAD is also pointing to that last commit.

 There are cases where HEAD can point to a commit instead of a branch.

 Git only has one HEAD at a given time, if you are wondering what it is you can run `cat .git/HEAD`to find out. HEAD is a pointer to the current branch, in some cases it could also be the current commit.
