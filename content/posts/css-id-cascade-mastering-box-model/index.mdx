## Difficulties with element width 
We will be creating a simple page with a header at the top and two columns beneath.

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Franklin Running Club</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <main class="main">
      <h2>Come join us!</h2>
      <p>
        The Franklin Running club meets at 6:00p
        every Thursday at the town square.
        Runs are three to five miles, at your own pace.
      </p>
    </main>
    <aside class="sidebar">
      <div class="widget"></div>
      <div class="widget"></div>
    </aside>
  </div>
</body>
```
- Let's start with some of the obvious styles: font, background-color for main page and main containers.
    - This will help you see the position and size of each as you go.
- Sometimes background-colors of elements are transparent, it might be helpful when styling it to give it a bgc so you can see it.

```css
body {
  background-color: #eee;            
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

header {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #0072b0;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
}

main {
  display: block; /* fixes IE bug */
}

.main {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
}


.sidebar {
  padding: 1.5em; /* Adds padding to the sidebar */
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
}
```
- Note: IE has a bug where `<main>` elements are rendered inline by default, we correct here with the above.

Next we are going to put our two columns in place. To begin we will use a **float-based layout**. You'll float the `main` and the `sidebar` to the left and give them widths of 70% and 30% respectively...

```css {2,3,9,10}
.main {
  float: left;
  width: 70%;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
}

.sidebar {
  float: left;
  width: 30%;
  padding: 1.5em;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
}
```
- Instead of two columns sitting side by side, they line wrapped. 
>- Even though you specified widths of 70% and 30%, the columns took up more than 100% of the available space.
    - The reason for that is because of the default behavior of the box model.
    - When you set the width or the height of an element, you're specifying the width or height of its content; any padding, border, and margins are then added to that width.
    - this means that an element with a 300px width, a 10px padding, and a 1 px border has a rendered width of 322px
        - this gets even more confusing when the units aren't the same.

In our example, the sidebar has a width of 30% plus 1.5em left and right padding. The main column has only a width of 70%. This brings the total of the two columns to 100% plus 3 ems.

### Avoiding Magic Numbers 
The naive fix is to reduce the width of one of the columns (the sidebar for example). 

>- [^ **What is a _magic number_ and why is it best to avoid it?**] On my screen, a width of 26% for the sidebar works, but this is unreliable. The 26% is known as a [**magic number**](). Instead of us using the desired value, we found one by making haphazard changes to our styles until we got the result we wanted. Magic numbers are to be avoided as they are are difficult to explain why the work, and more difficult for you and others to understand its behavior and what it will do.

- An alternative to this magicd number is to let the browser do the math with `calc()`, the columns are 3em to wide (due to padding) so we could simly say `calc(30% - 3em)`, however, there is still a better way!

### Adjusting the Box Model 
Because of the problem you just encountered, the default box model isn't typically what you'll want to use (The default for `box-sizing` is `content-box`). Instead, you'll want your specified widths to include padding and borders. We can do this with `box-sizing: border-box`.

With this model, padding doesn't make an element wider; it makes the content narrower. It also does this with height.

### Using universal border-box sizing 
It would be nice to fix the border-box sizing universally for all elements, and you can do so with the **universal selector** (`*`).
```css
*,
::before,
::after {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Applies border box
    to all elements and pseudo-elements on the page */
}
```
- After applying this to the page, `height` and `width`will always specify the actual height and width of an element. Padding won't change them.
- Note: adding this snippet at the top of your styles has become common practice.

If, however, you're using 3rd-party components with their own CSS and didn't write their styles with this fix in mind, you will need to adjust this otherwise you may see some broken styles. 

To fix, you need to target every element inside the component at the root level of your styles...

```css
:root {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Applies border 
    box sizing to the root element */
}
*,
::before,
::after {
    box-sizing: inherit; /*Tells all other elements
    and pseudo-elements to inherit their box sizing */
}
```
 
### Adding a gutter between columns 
- Visually its more appealing to have a small gap between columns or [**gutter**](). You can achieve this a few different ways. One way is by adding a padding to one column, but this isn't optimal.

#### Percent-based gutter margin 
- A better option could be by adding a margin to one of the columns and adjusting the widths of elements to account for this.
  - e.g. `.sidebar { width: 29%; margin-left: 1%; }`
  - This adds a gutter but its based on the outer container's width; the percentage is relative to the full width of the parent. 
  - What if you want to specify the gutter in units other than percentages?

#### Using `calc()` to substract the gutter from the width 
- Instead of moving 1% from the width into the margin, you can move 1.5 em. 
  - e.g. `.sidebar { width: calc(30% - 1.5em); margin-left: 1.5em; }`
  - Not only are we now able to use ems, we are also making it more explicit in our code what we are doing.

## Difficulties with element height
>- [^ **How is the normal document flow designed, with regard to width and height? What is it best to avoid doing with regards to element height?**]Working with element height is differnt than working with element width.
- Typically its best to avoid setting explicit heights 
- Normal document flow is designed with a constrainted width but an unlimited height.
  - because of this, height of a container organically determined by its contents, not by the container itself.

[**Normal document flow**]() refers to the default layout behavior of elements on the page. Inline elements flow along the text of the page, from left to right, line wrapping when they reach the edge of their container. Block-level  elements fall on the individual lines, with a line break above and below.

### Controlling overflow behavior 
>- [^ **What do you run the risk of by explicitly setting an element's height?**]You run the risk of *overflowing* the container. This happens when the content doesn't fit the specified constraint and renders outside of the parent element.


>- [^ **How can you control the behavior of overflowing content?**]You can control the exact behavior of the overflowing content with the `overflow` property.
  - `visibile` (default value): All content is visible, even when it overflows the container's edge.
  - `hidden`: content that overflwos the containers padding edge is clipped and won't be visible 
  - `scroll`: sidebars addded
  - `auto`: Scrollbars added only if overflow. (preferred over `scroll`)

### Horizontal overflow 
  - `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` are axis specific properties that take the same vales as overflow.
  - can get mixed results 

Be judicious with the use of scrollbars. Nested scrolling isn't a great UX. 

### Applying alternatives to percentage-based heights
>- [^ **Why is specifying height based on percentages problematic?**]Percentage refers to the size of an element's containing block; the height of that container, however, is typically determined by the height of its children. This produces a circular definition that the browswer can't resolve, so it'll ignore the declaration.
- For percentage-based heights to work, the parent must have an explicitly defined height. 

One reason that people try to use percentage-based heights is to make a container fill the screen. A better approach is to use the viewport-relative `vh` units.

A height of 100vh is exactly the height of the viewport. The most common use, though, is to create columns of equal height.

#### Columns of equal height 
The columns of equal height problem is one weakness that has plagued CSS from the beginning.
  - CSS at one time supplanted the use of HTML tables for layout out content.
    - at the time tables were the only way to produce two columns of equal height 
    - you could technically have set the column to a set height (but deal with overflow)
    - or you could have let each element evaluate to a different height based on content, both not very good options.
    - Things introduced later, like `display: table` and flexible box, aka flexbox helped solve this issue.

>- [^ **What is the best way to deal with columns of differing heights, to visualize reconcile their height?**]The best solution is to let columns size themselves naturally, and then extend the shorter column so that its height is equal to the height of the taller one.

#### CSS Table Layouts 
https://codepen.io/kelena_mori/pen/abvVjZL

To make two columns of equal height, you can opt for using a CSS-based table layout. Instead of using floats, you can make a container `display: table` and each column a `dislay: table-cell`

- You may notice there's no `table-row` element. With CSS tables the inclusion of a row element isn't as strict a requirement as it is with HTML tables.
- By default, an element with a `table` display value won't expand to a 100% width like a `block` element.
  - You have to declare width explicitly
  - that's because margins can't be applied to `table-cell` elements
  - ⭐To define space between cells of a table, you can use the `border-spacing` proeprty of the table element.
    - this property accepts two length values: one for x spacing, the other for y spacing.
      - this has a particular side effect: the value is also applied
