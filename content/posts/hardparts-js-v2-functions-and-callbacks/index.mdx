## Summary Questions

## Generalized Functions
Let's start off with, why do we even have functions?

### Why do we even have functions?
Let's see why....  
Create a function 10 squared
    - takes no input
    - returns 10*10
What is the syntax (the exact code we type?)

```js
function tenSquared() {
    returns 10*10;
}
```
Let's go over the exact wording of creating this function using the traditional function declaration style...
1. Using the keyword `function` called `tenSquared` with empty parens.
2. Body of the function `returns 10*10;`;
3. Close function body with `}`

Running the function, `tenSquared()` gets us the returned value `1001. Well what about `9` squared, writing the same function essentially. We don't want to keep writing this functionality, we want to keep things DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Instead of repeating and rewriting similar versions of what amounts to the same function, what we could we do instead? 

>* We can generalize the function to make it more reusable.
```js
function squareNum(num) {
    return num * num;
}
squareNum(10); //-->100
squareNum(9); //--> 81
squareNum(8); //--> 64
```

We save the code of it, but we leave a little bit of that code TBD, specifically we leave exactly what data, what thing we're gonna multiply by itself. 

This is our core premise of functions: making code we can write once and then reuse again and again with different values/data, that is what a *parameter* is for.

### Generalizing Functions
-*parameters* (placeholders) mean we don't need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function.
    - Then provide an actual value ('*argument*') when we run the function.

What if it wasn't just the data we could leave TBD? What if we could also leave a little bit of our code TBD? A little bit of functionality TBD, only to be determined once we actually run the function? Leaving a little bit of of functionality left blank, and when we run that function fill that functionality in?

That would make our functions super reusable, super general.

### Higher Order Functions
- *Higher order functions* follow this same principle.
    - We may not want to decide exactly what some of our functionality is until we run our function.

## Repeating Functionality
So we are giong to be building out this function here, that's going to take in an array...

### Now suppose we have a function `copyArrayAndMultiplyBy2`
```js
function copyArrayAndMultiplyBy2(array) {
    const output = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        output.push(array[i] * 2);
    }
    return output;
}
const myArray = [1,2,3];
const result = copyArrayAndMultiplyBy2(myArray);
```
