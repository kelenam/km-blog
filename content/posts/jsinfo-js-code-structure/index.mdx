## Statements
>[^ **What are statements?**]**Statements** are sytnax constructs and commands that perform actions.
- We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example...
```js
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
```

Usually statements are written on separte lines to make the code more readable.

## Semicolons
> [^ **Semicolons can be ommited in most cases when...**]A semicolon can be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
```js 
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
```
- In the above JS would consider the above an **implicit semicolon**. This is called [**automatic semicolon insertion**](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion)

**In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But "in most cases" does not mean "always"!**

But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.

Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.
```js 
alert("There will be an error")

[1, 2].forEach(alert)
```
>[^ **True/False: JavaScript assumes a semicolon before square brackets if it is on its own newline**] The error in the no-semicolon variant occurs because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...].
So, because the semicolon is not auto-inserted, the code in the first example is treated as a single statement. Here’s how the engine sees it:
```js
alert("There will be an error")[1, 2].forEach(alert)
```
But it should be two separate statements, not one. Such a merging in this case is just wrong, hence the error. This can happen in other situations.

> We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. 

## Comments
- One-line comments start with two forward slash characters `//`.
- Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk `/*` and end with an asterisk and a forward slash `*/.`
- Nested comments are not supported!

Please, don’t hesitate to comment your code.

Comments increase the overall code footprint, but that’s not a problem at all. There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. They remove comments, so they don’t appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.
