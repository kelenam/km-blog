Using a mobile first approach is just coding a site with mobile sizes in mind at first, then move on to larger screen sizes: tablets, then browsers.

Setup your base html template. 
- Emmet is useful here.
- Liveserver, the VSCode plugin, to preview your static page
- create and link a stylesheet

### HTML Template
- New file `assets` for all your image assets
- create a new `nav` element and call it `site-nav grid`
  - nested in nav is h1 : Cosmo Junkie
  - Followed by ul
    - then li with `<a href="#portfolio">`
    - then li with href of skills 

- Creating a nav with 3 linked sections via a tags in lis in an unordewred list.
- The sections and titles themselves aren't of class grid, only their contents which are wrapped in a div are going to be the things we want with a class of grid.
- we are also adding a form in the contact section
- we also have a footer with copyright and social media icons

### Mobile-First approach

#### Mobile-First Design
- Design & code websites for mobiles first
- Gradually built it up to larger screens / desktops
- Polar opposite of what we used to do, mobile-site based on the desktop site. Often lead to smooshed poor-UX versions of our desktop site.
- easier to start small than expand out then the other way around

Use your preferred design tool and start with how it will look like in mobile first, then based in that, how it might look on the desktop as you gain more space.

Next thing is to setup the media-queries to set the break points. Here is how our CSS is going to be structured.

```css
/* variables */

/* resets */

/* base styles */

/* fonts */

/* mobile styles */

/* small tablet styles */
```
