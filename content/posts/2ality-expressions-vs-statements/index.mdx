The difference between expressions and statements is important in JS.

## Statements and expressions
- JavaScript distinguishes expressions and statements. 
### Expressions
- [^ **What constitutes an expression in JS?**]An [**expression**]() produces a value and can be written wherever a value is expected, for example as an argument in a function call. Each of the following lines contains an expression:
```js 
myvar; 
3 + x;
myfunc("a", "b");
``` 
### Statements
>- [^ **What constitutes an statement in JS?**]Roughly, a [**statement**]() performs an action. Loops and if statements are examples of statements. A program is basically a sequence of statements (weâ€™re ignoring declarations here). 
>- [^ **What is a expression statement? Where can it be used?**]Wherever JavaScript expects a statement, you can also write an expression. Such a statement is called an [**expression statement**](). 
- [^ **True/False: You can write a statement where JS expects an expression.**]The reverse does not hold: you cannot write a statement where JavaScript expects an expression. For example, an `if` statement cannot become the argument of a function.
