### any
`any` Returns true if the provided predicate function returns `true` for at least one element in a collection, `false` otherwise.

Use `Array.prototype.some()` to test if any elements in the collection return `true` based on `fn`. Omit the second argument, `fn`, to use `Boolean` as default.


```js
const any = (arr, fn = Boolean) => arr.some(fn);

// Examples
any([0,1,2,0], x => x >= 2); //--> true
any([0,1,1,0]); //--> true
```

### When / Why would I use this?
Maybe you are looking at a data set where any group that has a passing predicate value should be included and passed onto a list for further analysis. Why you might use this over just using `.some()` might be providing `Boolean` as the default function if one is not provided. Perhaps it may be more composable for your use case?
