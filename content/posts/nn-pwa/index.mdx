## What are PWA'slug
- Creating Mobile Apps can appear daunting
- wouldn't it be easier to create a mobile app with just js like a web only it also has features like a mobile app?
    - install on homescreen
    - accesss offline
    - push notifications?

### Native Apps
- made with frameworks or device specific SDKS
- published and then downloaded from the app store
- can be installed on the mobile home screen
- runs on the device itself with access to device features
- can be used offline
- can use app push notifications

### Compare to PWAs
- can be made using vanilla JS, HTML, CSS
- accessed via a web address and not the app store
- can be installed on the mobile home screen
- runs in the browswer but with access to device features
- can be used offline
- can use web push notifications

However, they are still relatively new. Support not standard across all browswers.
