## Expressions
- easiest way to get started with JS is the console in the browser itself.
>- [^ **JavaScript programs themselves can be considered what?**]JavaScript programs are called [**statements**]().

>- One kind of statement is an [**expression statement**](), which consists of an [**expression**](), followed by a semicolon. A simple kind of expression is a number. (More precisely, the expression consists of the numerals that represent the number in base 10).

- Expressions representing numbers may be combined with operators (such as + or *) to form a compound expression that respresents the application of a corresponding primitive function to those numbers.
`137 + 429`  
`100 - 9`  
`10 / 5`  
- You can think of the `+`, `-`, `/` as an addition function.

Expressions such as these which contain other expressions as components, are called [**combinations**]().  
Combinations that are formed by an *operator* symbol in the middle, and *operand* expressions to the left and right of it, are called [**operator combinations**](). 

>* **The value of an operator combination is obtained by applying the function specified by the operator to the *arguments* that are the values of the operands.**  If you think back to the the last section, you can think of the operator as a sort of function and the numbers being added as data or essentially arguments that combinator function. E.g. ike `4 + 5` be arguments to an addition function represented by the plus operator. 

The convention of placing the operator between the operands is known as [**infix notation**](). It follows the mathematical notation that you already know.

As in mathematics, operator combinations can be nested, that is, they can take arguments that themselves are operator combinations:
`(3 * 5) + (10 - 6);`

- Parentheses are used to group operator combinations to avoid ambiguities.
- JS follows convention: mult/div stronger than add/sub.

We say that `*` and `/` have [**higher precedence**]() than `+` and `-`. Sequences of additions and subtractions are read from left to right, as are sequences of multiplications and divisions.  
`3 / 5 * 2 - 4 + 3;`
stands for
`(((3 / 5) * 2) - 4) + 3;`
We say that the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` are *left-associative*.

The interpreter always operates in the same basic cycle: It reads a statement from the browser, evaluates the statement, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a [**read-eval-print loop**](). Observe in particular that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the interpreter to print the value of the statement.

## Summary
- JavaScript programs can themselves be called **statements**.
- One such statement is a **statement expression**, which consists of an **expression** followed by a semicolon.
    - an example of an expression is a number, e.g. `486;`
- Expressions representing numbers can be combined with **operators** (such as + or *) to form a **compound expression**. 
    - operators represent the application of a corresponding primitive function to those numbers.
    - Here is an example of a compound expression: `138 + 39;`
- Expressions which contain other expressions as components, are called **combinations**. 
- **Combinations** that are formed by an **operator** symbol in the middle, and **operand** expressions on the left and right (that is, things the operator is operating upon), are called **operator combinations**.
