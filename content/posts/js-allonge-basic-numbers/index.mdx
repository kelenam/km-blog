JavaScript, like most languages, has a collection of literals. We saw that an expression consisting solely of numbers, like `42`, is a **literal**. It represents the number forty-two, which is 42 base 10. Not all numbers are base ten. 

Internally, both `042`(octal literal) and `34` have the same representation, as **double-precision floating point numbers**. 

For example, the largest integer JavaScript can safely handle is 9007199254740991, or `2^53 - 1`. Like most programming languages, JavaScript does not allow us to use commas to separate groups of digits.
