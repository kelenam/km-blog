## Right vs Left Brain
- It's a myth: sources: harvard, OECD, Enc. Brittanica.
- People often use it as a crutch/excuse to believe they are predisposed/predetermined skillsets

## Folder Structure advice
- `insp` our inspiration folder, will hold our inspiration 
- `src` hold our source files
- `dev` where we start using other tools.

## Perfection
Takes time and iterations, you will fail, keep trying, keep working at it.

- Perfection: Art and Fear quote. Quantity vs Quality, pottery class. The quantity group produced the best pots vs the group tasked with making one perfect pot.

## Designer vs. Developer 
Purview from this course is developers who can design, not going to be a course for designers.
