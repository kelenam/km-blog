You Need to Know:
- The DOM
- HTML elements
- how to use ES6 modules via import and via `<script type="module">`
- Some CSS and CSS Selectors
- ‚≠ê**That the browswers run JS only via events and callbacks.**
- Closures

Here are some refreshers

### es6 modules
- es6 modules can be loaded via the `import` keyword in a script or inline via...
- `<script type="module">` tag. Here's an example of both:
```html
<script type="module">
import * as THREE from './resources/threejs/r113/build/three.module.js';
...
</script>
```
* Paths must be absolute or relative. 
- Relative paths alwayus start with `./` or `../` which is different than other tags like `<img`> and `<a>` and css references.

### document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll
You can use `document.querySelector` to select the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- `document.querySelectorAll` returns all elements that match a CSS selector.

### You don't need onbody
``<body onload="somefunction()">` is a deprecated (20-year+ old way of doing things). Instead put your scripts at the bottom of the page or use the `defer` property.

### Know how closures work 
```js
function a(v) {
    const foo = v;
    return function() {
        return foo;
    };
}

const f = a(123);
const g = a(456);
console.log(f()); // --> prints 123
console.log(g()); // --> prints 456
```
In the code above the function `a` creates a new function every time it's called. That function `closes` over the variable `foo`.

### Understand how this works
`this` is not magic. It's effectively a variable that is automatically passed to functions just like an argument is passed to a function. The simple explanation is when you call a function directly like....
```js
someFunction(a,b,c);
```
`this` will be `null` (when in strict mode or in a module) where as when you call a function via the dot operator `.` like this.
```js
someObject.someFunction(a,b,c);
```
`this` will be set to `someObject`.

The part where people get confused is with callbacks
```js
const callBack = someObject.someFunction;
loader.load(callback);
```
The above doesn't work as one might expect because when `loader.load` calls the callback it's not calling it with the dot `.` operator so by default `this` will be `null` (unless the loader explicitly sets it to something). If you want `this` to be `someObject` when the callback happens, you need to tell JavaScript that by binding it to some function.
```js
const callback = someObject.someFunction.bind(someObject);
loader.load(callback)
```
From MDN:
> A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some  differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.
> 
> In most cases, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called (**runtime binding**). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the `bind()` method *to set the value of a function's `this` regardless of how it's called*, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own `this` binding (it retains the `this` value of the enclosing lexical context).

### ES5/ES6/ES7 stuff
- `var` is deprecated. Use `const` and/or `let`
- No reason to use `var` at this point EVER.
- Use `const` if the variable will never be reassigned which is most of the time.
- Use `let` in those cases where the value changes.

#### Use for(elem of collection) never for(elem in collection)
- `for of` is new, `for in` is old. `for in` had issues that are solved by `for of`

Example: iterating over all key/value pairs of an object
```js
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(someObject) {
    console.log(key, value);
})
```

#### Use `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` where useful
- Arrays added the functions `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`, and are used fairly extensively in modern JS.

#### Use destructuring
Assume an object `const dims = { width: 300, height: 150}`

Old code:
```js
const width = dims.width;
const height = dims.height;
```

New code:
```js
const { width, height } = dims;
```

#### Use object declaration short cuts
Old Code:
```js
 const width = 300;
 const height = 150;
 const obj = {
   width: width,
   height: height,
   area: function() {
     return this.width * this.height
   },
 }
```

New Code:
```js
const width = 300;
const height = 150;
const obj = {
    width,
    height,
    area() {
        return this.width * this.height;
    },
};
```

#### Use the spread operator (...)

The spread operator has a ton of uses:
```js
function log(className, ...args) {
    const elem = document.createElement('div');
    elem.className = className;
    elem.textContent = [...args].join(' ');
    document.body.appendChild(elem);
}
```
Another...
```js
const position = [1,2,3];
somemesh.position.set(...position);
```

#### Use classes
The syntax for making class like objects pre ES5 was relying on factory functions (what es5 classes are under the hood).
As of ES5 you can now use the `class` keyword closer to the sytle of C++/C#/JavaScript

#### Understand getters and setters
The `get` syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up.
The `set` syntax binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.

#### Use arrow functions where appropriate
**Arrow functions** are especially useful with callbacks and promises.
```js
loader.load((texture) => {
    // use texture
});
```
* **Arrow functions bind `this`**
```js
const foo (args) => {/* code */}
```
...is a shortcut for...
```js
const foo = (function(args) {/* code */ }.bind(this));
```

#### Promises as well as async/await
**Promises** help with asynchronous code. Async/await help use promises.


### Learn JavaScript coding conventions
- Variables, function names, method names, in JavaScript are all lowerCasedCamelCase. Constructors, the names of classes are CapitalizedCamelCase
- Use a linter like ESLint

### Consider using Visual Studio Code
