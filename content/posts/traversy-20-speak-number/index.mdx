## Setup 
The speech recognition API is not widely supported (is in Chrome), in Firefox. you have to change a flag. 

In the url bar of a ff windows, you can say `about:config`, and then accept risk and continue, this will let use change a flag in the browser, then search for speech, and set the `media.webspeech.recognition.force_enable` set to true as well as the `media.webspeech.recognition.enable`

## HTML 
- img src our mic image 
- h1: Guess a number between 1 - 100 
- h3: Speak the number into your microphone 
- div#msg.msg (ultimately will be empty, generate contents dynamically with js)
    - div: You said 
        - span.box: 20 
        - div: GO HIGHER

## CSS

## JS 
Check out MDN for the API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition

We are going to be using the `SpeechRecognition.start()` and the `result` and `end` event. 

### Speech recognition
We need to initialize a speech recognition object 
Some browsers you may need to implement the webkit API....
```js 
window.SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition
```

Pretty much just bringing in one variable: the msgEl.
- set variable for msg element 
- We need a const for a randomNumber set to the function call of getRandomNumber() which we will now write
- function getRandomNumber()
    - return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
- create object for speech recognition api 
- initialize a new instance of SpeechRecognition, by setting to a variable the result of `new window.SpeechRecognition`
- then call recognition.start();
- we then need to listen for the `result` event 
    - recognition.addEventListener, listening for `result` then callback of onSpeak
- create onSpeak function, part of event listener, so pass in e param
    - e gives us back a ton of stuff, we want the results array 
        - within it there is a nested array at 0 
            - another one at index 0, -SpeechRecognitionAlternative 
                - within is a property called transcript, or whatever we said. 
    - const msg = e.results[0][0].transcript
    - we want to call writeMessage(msg), then checkNumber(msg), we'll create both of these. 

### `writeMessage` and `checkNumber`
- writeMessage(msg)
    - set the innerHTML of our msgEl with template literals 
        - a div with : You said
             - span with class box, with the contents of the msg 
- checkMessage(msg)
    - new variable that converts msg to number 
    - check if valid number , we can use the Number and is NaN 
        - Then we can append the inner html to a div giving an error message 
        - then return 
    - Then write if to check if number is in range 
        - then append message to guess in range for guess 
        - then return 
    - check if num equal to random number 
        - then write inner HTML of document.body to     
            h2: congrats you guessed the number!, it was ${num}
            - button.play-again#play-again,  to play again 
    - else if , number is higher, then say go lower, about to msgEl 
        - number is lower go higher. 
- addEvent listener to the document body for playing again 
- 

### Only letting us guess once issue
Don't want to reload, because that will change number, so we need to add a new event, listening to end event on recognition and cb should be arrow function that just calls recognition.start() again. 

## Notes
I was having issues with TS flagging `Number.isNaN()` as Number not having this method, so I used `isNaN` instead.

We can add an event to the body of the page since our DOM is already painted and we are creating a Play Again button after the fact. We use e.target.id to check if the id of the button matches 'play-again' and restart the game by reloading the page. We make use of the `window.location.reload()` function.
