## VIM Overview & Modes
### VIM 
- **VIM:** stands for Vi Improved

- it's a text editor on any servers

- **insert mode**: text editing, `i`
- **command mode**: Primary mode, `esc` 
- **last line mode**: searching, saving, exiting, `:`

How to quit VIM:
`ESC :q!`

## Server Exercise

### What does a server do?
- it serves content
- it responds to request
- just a computer
- when you are doing local dev, your own computer is a server
- anything that can essentially respond to requests/ server content is a server

## Server Solution
```js 
const http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.write('Hello, World!');
        res.end();
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server started! Listening on port 3000');
```
- The basics of every single node server you're ever going to use is this callback with request/response. It maybe you might be using promises, you must use `asyn`/`await`, but they are always going to be request/response, and a third paramter is usually next, which is used for creating middleware.

- So again, basic pattern of node servers: resquest, response

- Generally ports below 1000 are reserved
- The internet runs over port 80
- On HTTP the Internet runs over port 443.
