## VIM Overview & Modes
### VIM 
- **VIM:** stands for Vi Improved
    - its one of those meta definitions
- it's a text editor on any servers

- **insert mode**: text editing, `i`
- **command mode**: Primary mode, `esc` 
- **last line mode**: searching, saving, exiting, `:`

How to quit VIM:
`ESC :q!`

## Server Exercise

### What does a server do?
- it serves content
- it responds to request
- just a computer
- when you are doing local dev, your own computer is a server
- anything that can essentially respond to requests/ server content is a server

## Server Solution
```js 
const http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.write('Hello, World!');
        res.end();
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server started! Listening on port 3000');
```
- The basics of every single node server you're ever going to use is this callback with request/response. It maybe you might be using promises, you must use `asyn`/`await`, but they are always going to be request/response, and a third paramter is usually next, which is used for creating middleware.

- So again, basic pattern of node servers: resquest, response

- Generally ports below 1000 are reserved
- The internet runs over port 80
- On HTTP the Internet runs over port 443.
 
## Data Centers & the Cloud
- Typically servers are parts of stacks, and they are built in particular ways that consumer grade stuff is not, they are optimized for serving. Optimized for multithreading, forking, and high CPU/RAM stuff.
- Servers typically live in data centers, lots of fans, super clean environment, high security.
- Consume a ton of power.
- **Data centers** are often shared between companies, can rent a fraction of their services, or own the entire center if you're a big enough company.

### The Cloud
Used to be companies ran their own servers, they were in charge of their own hardwaare/software.
- Center could be anywhere in the world now, further away from server the more hops needed to get data.
- least amount of hopes == less places/things to go wrong, and its faster

The great thing about the cloud is : elastic computing.
[**elastic computing**](), Scaling as needed, elastic. You provision for only things youre using/needing. Don't have to buy more and more hardware. Costs can adjust with allocation. Can scale up based on times of years. On demand capacity.

We, as smaller cos/devs, likeyl only need a fraction of a fraction of a server. Today we'll just provision one core.

**Process isolation** Is the idea that the slices of a server can't talk with one another, you wouldn't want knowledge/access to anyone elses slice of the server.
