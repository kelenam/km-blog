No one path, for project developments, so take everything with a grain of salt.

## Different Types of Projects 
- **Freelance Project**: Dealing directly with the client 
- **Company Project**: Dealing with a PM/lead
- **Your own Project**: Dealing with yourself 

## Get ALL the requirements 
You want to be absolutely clear on all requirements of the project before you begin working. You want to have all the materials you need: mise en place. Have a checklist of questions to ask: content, design, team layout/dynamic. 
- **Objective & Scope**
- **Purpose**
- **Target Audience**
- **Technology Requiremetns / API**
- **Budget (Document EVERYTHING)**
    - Expected costs, API/Tool costs, make this clear up front
    - Get things in writing/agreements/contracts/etc. 
- **Deployment**

## Create a Timeline 
- Carefully establish a timeline based on all that stuff 
- Document your timeline/tasks
- For clients, always tell them longer than you think 

## Wireframing & Mockups 
- Know what the final result will look like
- Create wireframes or mockups using PS, Sketch, etc 
    - Won't always match exactly to design, but you want a general idea to guide you.
- What components will go where?
- Send for approval
    - Clearify mockups before development/coding

## Start Coding (Finally!)
- Use everything we have talked about as a guide 
- Setup your dev environment 
- Research other projects that are similar
- Set up Git repo with branches 
- Everyone has their own workflow  

## Communicate 
- Keep in communication with the client/manager/team 
- Make sure youre on the same page 
    - Might feel like pulling teeth, but not leaving anyone in the dark is key.
- Project management software may be a good idea 
- Get feedback 
 
## Testing 
- Be thorough with your testing 
- Test on multiple platforms/OS/browsers
- After deployment, test more...
