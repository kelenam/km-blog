## Review Questions

## Intro 
### Pre-Flexbox
- Use different positional properties, such as 'absolute'
- floats and clear fixes
- fixed heights for clumns

### Enter flexbox...
- flexbox is a ccss display type designed to help us craft CSS layouts much easier
- control the position, size, and spacing of elements relative to their parent elements and each other
- works great responsively

### Flexbox Basics
- Apply a display type of flex to the **parent container**, all the children then become **flex items**

### benefits
easy to create
- nav bars and menus
- grid layouts
- bar charts
- equal heights column

Old verions of IE may not support flexbox, `Modernizr`js can help you coverage.

## Flex Containers
Default behavior is that flex children go from left to right in a row.
Normally we would have to do some clear-fixes and float stuff.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <style>
        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
        }
        .box {
            height: 100px;
            min-width: 100px;
        }
        .one {
            background-color: red;
        }
        .two {
            background-color: blue;
        }
        .three {
            background-color: green;
        }
    </style>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box one"></div>
            <div class="box two"></div>
            <div class="box three"></div>
        </div>

    </div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Flex Grow
We will be taking a look at the flex grow property., 
When there is available room left in the container, we want each one of these items to grow into that available room, we do that with, `flex-grow: ` property in the child component we want to grow.
```css
.box {
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```
- the number we pass into `flex-grow` is the "growth rate", how much we want this item to grow by, if we gave each of the children equal values, they would all equally fill the container.
- we can mimic the 12 row grid, spacing by dividing up equal portions of that 12 unit container, doing a break down like:
6,4,2 (which would be the same as saying 3,2,1)
- flex-grow is always relative to the elements next to it.
```css
.one {
    background-color: red;
    flex-grow: 3;
}
.two {
    background-color: blue;
    flex-grow:2;
}
.three {
    background-color: green;
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```
