## Review Questions

## Intro 
### Pre-Flexbox
- Use different positional properties, such as 'absolute'
- floats and clear fixes
- fixed heights for clumns

### Enter flexbox...
- flexbox is a css display type designed to help us craft CSS layouts much easier
- control the position, size, and spacing of elements relative to their parent elements and each other
- works great responsively

### Flexbox Basics
- Apply a display type of flex to the **parent container**, all the children then become **flex items**

### benefits
easy to create
- nav bars and menus
- grid layouts
- bar charts
- equal heights column

Old verions of IE may not support flexbox, `Modernizr`js can help you coverage.

## Flex Containers
Default behavior is that flex children go from left to right in a row.
Normally we would have to do some clear-fixes and float stuff.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

<body>
    <style>
        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
        }
        .box {
            height: 100px;
            min-width: 100px;
        }
        .one {
            background-color: red;
        }
        .two {
            background-color: blue;
        }
        .three {
            background-color: green;
        }
    </style>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box one"></div>
            <div class="box two"></div>
            <div class="box three"></div>
        </div>

    </div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Flex Grow
We will be taking a look at the flex grow property., 
When there is available room left in the container, we want each one of these items to grow into that available room, we do that with, `flex-grow: ` property in the child component we want to grow.
```css
.box {
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```
- the number we pass into `flex-grow` is the "growth rate", how much we want this item to grow by, if we gave each of the children equal values, they would all equally fill the container.
- we can mimic the 12 row grid, spacing by dividing up equal portions of that 12 unit container, doing a break down like:
6,4,2 (which would be the same as saying 3,2,1)
- flex-grow is always relative to the elements next to it.
```css
.one {
    background-color: red;
    flex-grow: 3;
}
.two {
    background-color: blue;
    flex-grow:2;
}
.three {
    background-color: green;
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```
## Flex Shrink
`flex shrink` determines the rate at which these elements shrink. You won't notice anything until you start to bring in the browser/shrink the window, the rate at which we've assigned the properties will shrink at their corresponding rates. 
```css
.one {
    background-color: red;
    flex-shrink: 3;
}
.two {
    background-color: blue;
    flex-shrink:2;
}
.three {
    background-color: green;
    flex-shrink: 1;
}
```
The higher the number, the faster this will shrink in relation to other sibiling shrink' property.
- Note: flex-shrink, Not used too frequently

## Flex Wrap
So say we have a min-width on our rectangles of about 200px, that means those items can't shrink beyond 200px. What will happen is if we shrink past a certain point, becaues the items can't condense past a certain point they will just go offscreen or overflow and that looks bad.

This is where flex-wrap comes in. Once an element reaches its min width instead it can wrap to th next line instead of going off page.

>* The way that we apply the flex-wrap property is by doing so to the parent's container. Now any children of that parent will wrap when they need to.

```css
<style>
        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }
        [...]
```
- The properties of flex-wrap... 
    - `wrap-reverse`: it will go wrap, upwards (if row), stack above
    - `nowrap`: default behavior, it will not wrap

## Flex Basis
`flex-basis` is similar to `min-width`, in that it defines a starting width of each of our elements, so instead of saying: `min-width` we could say...`flex-basis: 200px` in our `.box` class and all of those children elements will start at a width of 200px. So it behaves the same way with wrap, in that, if it comes to a certain point, where any of the elements can't be a minimum of 200px in width, then they are going to wrap to the next line.

The reason they aren't growing to the full width, is because we haven't applied that flex-grow property to them.

### Applying flex-basis to children
This behaves the same way as min-width, with a catch.
```css
   .box {
            height: 100px; 
            flex-grow: 1;
        }
    .one {
        background-color: red;
        flex-basis: 100px;
    }
    .two {
        background-color: blue;
        flex-basis: 200px;
    }
    .three {
        background-color: green;
        flex-basis: 300px;
    }
```
- Applying flex-basis to the children will each give them different starting widths, we can apply a flex-grow to all of them, and they are all going to grow to fill up the available space, but they are all going to have different widths because of their flex basis properties.
- remember, flex-basis, is like saying, the minimum width of any object can be the specified value. It can be bigger, but it can't be smaller.

### flex-basis vs. min-width
If we applied a hard `min-width` value of the `.box` class to be `500px`, that means that if we shrink/view past 500px, we will be forced into the overflow and need to scroll to see the whole object, because remember, min-width is saying, I CAN'T be smaller than 500px so you will have to scroll to see all 500px of me.

However...

>- ‚≠ê If you use `flex-basis: 500px` instead of min-width, what happens is that past 500px you they will just flex shrink as normal flex items would. 

### The `flex` shorthand property
So far we've seen: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. Well all of this can be combined into one shorthand notation, called `flex`.

The syntax is `flex: {flex-grow value} {flex-shrink value} {flex-basis value}`

This is much easier to manage and is the preferred way to write it.
```css
.box {
    height: 100px; 
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex: 1 0 200px;
}
```
If you wrote something like `flex: 1` this would translate to, set the flex grow to 1, set the flex shrink to 1, and set the flex basis to 0 by default.

## Creating a Menu with Flexbox
Here is the base document:
```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>flex menu</title>
    <style>
        * {
            font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
        }
        body {
            background: none;
        }
        .wrapper {
            width: 100%;
            max-width: 960px;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }
        nav {
            background: #333;
        }
        nav ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
        }
        nav a {
            text-decoration: none;
            text-align: center;
            color: #ffffff;
            display: block;
            padding: 10px;
        }
        nav a:hover{
            background-color: #555555;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Store</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Lets write some media queries for our larger screens.
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    nav ul {
        display: flex;
    }
    nav li {
        flex: 1 1 0;
    }
}
```
- The first thing we are doing is grabbing our flex container in this case the ul.
    - this makes them all line up left to right.
    - saying `flex: 1 1 0` makes them all spread out nicely.

### `justify-content` 
If we uncomment out the `flex: 1 1 0` we just wrote we can play around with another property called.
- `justify-content`, it has a few different values we can use:
    - `center`: center
    - `flex-end`: right specified
    - `flex-start`: left side
    - `space-evenly`: space evently
    - `space-around`: gives them equal spacing around each element
    - `space-between`: equal space between, but it gets rid of the spacing on the edges.

```
## Creating Nested Menu's with FLexbox
Here we are just adding another ul with a class of social:
```html
<ul class="social">
    <li><a href="" class="fb">Facebook</a></li>
    <li><a href="" class="tw">Twitter</a></li>
</ul> 
```
Why create a separate `ul` element? Well we want to style them a bit differently and have them grow at different rates
Two separate flex containers (since styled accordingly), we want to go ahead and make the parent element, the `nav` itself a display of flex, so that the two child `ul`s themselves become flex items.
That will allow us to say, `space-between` for our justify-content so we get them on either end of each.
```css
nav {
    background: #333;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```
Let's style these icons now, instead to being images/icons instead of just text.
```css
    * {
        font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;
        margin: 0;
    }
    body {
        background: none;
    }
    .wrapper {
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 960px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    nav {
        background: #333;
    }
    nav ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        padding: 0; 
    }
    nav a {
        text-decoration: none;
        text-align: center;
        color: #ffffff;
        display: block;
        padding: 10px; 
    }
    nav a:hover{
        background-color: #555555;
    } 
    nav li { 
        flex: 1 1 0;
    } 
    a.tw {
        background: url(img/tw.png) no-repeat center;
        background-size: 80%;
    }
    a.fb {
        background: url(img/fb.png) no-repeat center;
        background-size: 80%;
    }
    .social a {
        text-indent: -10000px;
    }
    .social {
        max-width: 80px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }

    /* flex styles */
    nav ul.social {
        flex: 1 1 0;
        display: flex;
    } 
    @media screen and (min-width: 700px) {
        nav ul {
            display: flex;
        }
        nav li {
            flex: 1 1 0;
        }
        nav {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
        }
        .social {
            margin: 0;
        }
    }
```
The reason we use the text-indent is to push that text off screen, so that we only get the icons. We can't keep the a blank bc the icons will appear top not centered. Aside: I'm not entirely sure why we can't just keep it blank or use a span tag within the a or something. I'll come back to this later. 

We want to give our nav ul.social a flex property , flex: 1 1 0, and give social class themselves, a max-width.
- Looks okay, for big screens but looks smashed and not centered for smaller screens.
    - margin: 0 auto;

- I'm still a bit unsure about, about `flex`, I'm not 100% confident in understanding how flex basis or the last param of `flex` has 0 and 1 values and what they correspond to.
    I'm still not too too clear, but was helpful:

> "0" and "auto" flex-basis will be different in most if not all situations: numeric values are interpreted as specific widths, so zero would be the same as specifying "width: 0" (and thus will collapse the element to its smallest possible width given the content, or to zero itself if its overflow is hidden.)

## Axis
*The default behavior of flexbox is to stack items, horizontally, starting from left to right, in a row.*

>- We can override the default behavior and have these items stack in a column; we do so by using the `flex-flow` property to the flex container, and that controls the flex flow of all the flex elements within it. This looks like, `flex-flow: column`.

If we were to apply this to our example, this would stack our boxes but they would all be full width. The reason these boxes are all full width, is because they are block level elements and they take up 100% width of their parent element basis. Our `flex` basis of `100px` in `flex: 0 0 100px` doesn't work because they are no longer going in a row, this flex basis now controls the **height** of these elements because they are now going in a column downwards.

![](/flex-row-v-column.png)

When we change the value of `flex-flow` we are just changing the direction of the axis. When its set to `row` the main axis is going horizontally, in a row. The element always follow the main axis.

The [***cross axis***]() is always perpendicular to the main axis.

>* `justify-content` is only ever applied to the main axis.

If we have items in a row, and we say `justify-content: center`, we will get all of those 3 boxes centered aligned in the top row.

If we then went and said: `flex-flow: column`, the main axis changes from left-right to top-bottom. 
- In order to see these things center aligned, we have to give the container a bigger height...
```css
.flex-container {
    background: white;
    height: 100px;
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 800px;
}
```
If we have the above: we will get 3 boxes, 100px in width, justified to the center in the first row of the page (at the top), if we simply changed `flex-flow: row` to `flex-flow: column` we would get 3 full width bars centered aligned vertically to the center of the page.

### `column-reverse` and `row-reverse`
So this switches the direction of the main axis, instead of the row moving from left to right as `row` (the default does), `row-reverse` will make the row move from right to left same with vertically, instead of going from top bottom it goes bottom to top.
 
## Align items on the Cross Axis
So in the last video we talked about properties that only effect the main axis, one of those properties is `justify-content` We also have a property that just effects the cross-axis which is `align-items` a similar thing just going instead in the cross axis.

So now if we take our example from above:
```css
.flex-container {
    background: white;
    height: 100px;
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    /* align-items: center */
    justify-content: center;
    height: 800px;
}
```
And instead of saying `justify-content` we said `align-items: center` we would get our 3 cubes, aligned vertically (or more specifically along their cross axis)

- If we combine that with `justify-content`, we get those 3 boxes centered to the whole wrapper.
- And just like center we can also use `flex-start` or end on our `align-items` property. 

- If we went ahead and change the flex-flow to column instead (as well as changed the width property of the .box class to 100px) and said `justify-content` center, we would get 3 vertically stacks cubes (100x100) centered vertically, remember, because changing flex flow to column changes the directtion of the main axis.
- and if we said `align-items: center` we can center that stack to the middle of page.

The key takeaway here is knowing which direction your main and cross axis are going in .

## Element Order

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>element order </title>
</head> 
    <style>
        #blocks {
            display: flex;
            margin: 10px;
            justify-content: space-between;
            border: 1px solid teal;
        }
        #blocks div {
            flex: 0 0 100px;
            padding: 40px 0;
            text-align: center;
            background-color: #ddd;
        }
        .one{order: 0;}
        .two{order: 0;}
        .three{order: 0;}
        .four{order: 0;}
    </style>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <section id="blocks">
            <div class="one">1</div>
            <div class="two">2</div>
            <div class="three">3</div>
            <div class="four">4</div>
        </section>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
If we wanted to change the order of these blocks, how would we do this with just flexbox?

>* We can do so with just one property and that property is the `order` property.

The default `order` value for each property is set to 0. If they all default to 0 the webpage is just going to present them in *source order*, as they are written in the code. The way it works, is that the lowest number goes first, the highest number goes last.
- You can also use minus/negative numbers as well.

## Key Insights
- `flex-basis` v.s `min-width`.
- Refresher: elements, according to how they are styled, can easily move beyond the bounds of their parent element so long as the parent element styling is less than/smaller than the styling of its children.

## Thoughts
So a bit of self-review:
```html

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <style>
        * {
            padding: 0;
            margin: 0;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        body {
            background-color: #999;
        }
        .flex-container {
            background: white;
            height: 100px;
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }
        .box {
            border: 1px solid black;
            height: 100px;
            width: 100px;
        }
        .one {
            background-color: cornflowerblue;
        }
        .two {
            background-color: cornsilk;
        }
        .three {
            background-color: #ee9999;
        }

If we added a `flex: 1` property to our `.box` classe, we would get the elements to spread out evenly across the top, likely because `flex` is a shorthand for `flex: 1 1 0`. Well... I guess this is kind of wrong:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37386244/what-does-flex-1-mean

Note, that the below is from 2017 so may no longer apply, however, it helped me clarify the absence of unit question I had about flex-basis, how and what a `0` and `1` value for `flex-basis` actually describes.

"In some browsers:

`flex:1`; does not equal `flex:1 1 0`;

`flex:1`; = `flex:1 1 0n`; (where n is a length unit).

    flex-grow: A number specifying how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items.
    flex-shrink A number specifying how much the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items
    flex-basis The length of the item. Legal values: "auto", "inherit", or a number followed by "%", "px", "em" or any other length unit.

The key point here is that `flex-basis` requires a length unit."
 
In the code example above, if we said: `min-width:100px` instead of `width:100px` this would get us the same kind of result of 3x 100px boxes.
Therefore if we said, `flex: 0 0 100px`, this should be the same thing.

```css
.box {
    width: 100px; /* this would be loosely equivalent to...
    min-width: 100px */
}
```
In the above though, if we added a `flex: 1` attribute to `box` it would override both width and min width to flex grow/shrink the boxes (also because we are overriding the width and min width properties because of the implicit `0` for `flex-basis` in `flex`, at least I believe so)

## Review Answers
1. The default behavior of flexbox is to stack items, horizontally, starting from left to right, in a row.
1. Flex elements always follow the direction of which axis?
1. `justify-content` only works on the **main axis**. And what the main axis is depends on our `flex-flow` property.
