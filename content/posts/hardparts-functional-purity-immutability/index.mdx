## Pure Functions
#### Listing out our ‘lines of code’ (functions) by name with each one’s consequence limited to only affect the next ‘line’ (function call/invocation)
```js 
const multiplyBy2 = x => x*2
const add3 = x => x+3
const divideBy5 = x => x/5
const subtract4 = x => x-4
const reduce = (array, howToCombine, buildingUp) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        buildingUp = howToCombine(buildingUp, array[i])
    }
    return buildingUp
};

const runFunctionOnInput = (input,fn) => { return fn(input) };
const output = reduce([
        multiplyBy2,
        add3,
        divideBy5,
        subtract4
    ],
    runFunctionOnInput, 11
);
``` 
> [^**What is point free style? What is its main benefit?**]The functions are run through with data one by one, the style is called **point free**, sometimes ironically known as **pointless**. We write out a list of functions, and we do not explicitly state their arguments and their return values in that line in which we use them...

- we don't explicitly state the calling of them with either.
- instead we rely on just listing them out and knowing the structure by which they're executed
    - which is just input then output of that line which is input of the next line
- this is known as [**point free style**]() of coding.
- increases readability: it's do do do do, not do with that value do those with two values...
    - every line there we know exactly what its doing
    - no looking up the rest of my code if it has effects elsewhere
    - it's only effect is that very next line 
    - and we get to remove the worry about arguments then becuase its only input, we don't need to explicitly state inputs because I know the only input is the output from the previous line.

### Pure functions
- Functions as tiny units to be combined and run automatically must be highly absolutely predictable
- We rely on using their evaluated result to pass the input to the next unit of code (automatically). Any **side effects** would destroy this...
```js
let num = 10
const add3 = x => {
    num++
    return x+3
}
add3(7)
```
`num++` is a side-effect, its mutating a global var, a consequence of the function.

## Immutability
A [**side-effect**]() is when a function has consequences outside of its own lines in local memory that isn't exclusively the returning of some value. 

A function with **side-effects** would be known as an **impure function** and would destroy everything we are trying to accomplish with reduce.

If this is the case, then let's make sure we have no side effects. There may be a side-effect we missed....

### Immutability
```js 
const array = [1,2,3]
const multiplyBy2 = num => num*2

const result = array.map(multiplyBy2) // [2,4,6]
const newResult = array.map(multiplyBy2) // [2,4,6]
// if map mutated array instead of making a copy
// of that array, and modifying the copy
// we could get out [4,8,12] the second time we 
// ran newResult. Thankfull that's not the case.
```

If we want the only consequence of map to be on that line and to achieve ‘referential transparency’ (I can replace the function call with its output and it’s the same) - then I need to preserve my data and not manipulate it at all.

> [^ **What is a possible hidden danger that might make our functions impure if we're not paying attention?**] JavaScript passes a reference (‘link back to the globally saved version’) to the `arr` when it’s inserted into the function `map`. If we change (‘mutate’) the input array our function is not pure - it’s unpredictable - I can’t figure out what it does just be reading it and looking at its output there in that line - undoes all our hard work

> In order to make sure every line of code we run is self-contained on that line only to not mutate any data where it is passed by reference by a link back to its original version. And it's that little hidden thing where we might otherwise break our pure function rules without realizing it.

## Pure Functions & Immutability Review

### Pure functions & immutability
- **Easier to add features** - Every saved function be safely used in new combinations , confident it won’t break other parts of the app
- **More readable** - Every line is ‘complete’ - it’s fully descriptive - exactly what it does is discoverable its name and limited to that input/output
- **Easier to debug** - No 1000s of lines of interdependence
