## Installation 
Downloading the Rails installer http://railsinstaller.org/en

This will setup, by default (in Windows): `C:\Sites`, a directory where rails projects can be stored is created for you, there is a `todo` directory automatically created for you

## Getting Started
- We want to create a new application, we do so by saying `rails new projectName`
    - You specify a flag `--api` to give yourself extra tools inside of your app if you're building an API 
    - e.g. `rails new myarticles --api`

## Using SQL 
- When you install/create a rails application and you don't add an extra flags, by default its going to use sqlite. 
- To install mysql use the command: `gem install mysql2`
    - In our `Gemfile`, comment out `gem 'sqlite3'` and replace will `gem mysql2`
- We're going to be using SQL, to do this, go into our `config` file then the `database.yml` file
    - change the `adapater` to `mysql2`
    - also add the username and password for our sql database:
        - `username: yourUserName`
        - `password: yourPassword`
    - then under `development`
        - change your `database` name to your database.
- Rails uses database-migrations which allows you to create database/tables through command line.

## Server
Rails comes with a rails server, you run it by using the command `rails s`
