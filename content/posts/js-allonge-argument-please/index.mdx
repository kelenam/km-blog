Up to now, we‚Äôve looked at functions without arguments. We haven‚Äôt even said what an argument is, only that our functions don‚Äôt have any.
 

Let‚Äôs make a function with an argument:
```
(room) => {}
``` 
This function has one argument, room, and an empty body. Here‚Äôs a function with two arguments and an empty body:
```
(room, board) => {}
``` 

I‚Äôm sure you are perfectly comfortable with the idea that this function has two arguments, `room`, and `board`. What does one do with the arguments? Use them in the body, of course. What do you think this is?

``` 
(diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265
``` 

It‚Äôs a function for calculating the circumference of a circle given the diameter. I read that aloud as ‚ÄúWhen applied to a value representing the diameter, this function returns the diameter times 3.14159265.‚Äù

Remember that to apply a function with no arguments, we wrote `(() => {})()`. **To apply a function with an argument (or arguments), we put the argument (or arguments) within the parentheses**, like this:
```
((diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265)(2)
  //=> 6.2831853
```
You won‚Äôt be surprised to see how to write and apply a function to two arguments:
```
((room, board) => room + board)(800, 150)
  //=> 950
```

## a quick summary of functions and bodies
How arguments are used in a body‚Äôs expression is probably perfectly obvious to you from the examples, especially if you‚Äôve used any programming language (except for the dialect of BASIC‚Äìwhich I recall from my secondary school‚Äìthat didn‚Äôt allow parameters when you called a procedure).

> Expressions consist either of representations of values (like `3.14159265`, `true`, and `undefined`), operators that combine expressions (like `3 + 2`), some special forms like `[1, 2, 3]` for creating arrays out of expressions, or `function (arguments) {body-statements}` for creating functions.

One of the important possible statements is a return statement. A `return` statement accepts any valid JavaScript expression.

This loose definition is recursive, so we can intuit (or use our experience with other languages) that since a function can contain a return statement with an expression, we can write a function that returns a function, or an array that contains another array expression. Or a function that returns an array, an array of functions, a function that returns an array of functions, and so forth:
```js 
() => () => {};

() => [ 1, 2, 3];

[1, [2, 3], 4];

() => [
    () => 1,
    () => 2,
    () => 3
  ];
```

## call by value
>- [^ **What does it mean that JavaScript uses a 'call by value' evaluation strategy?**]Like most contemporary programming languages, JavaScript uses the ‚Äúcall by value‚Äù evaluation strategy ([**Evaluation strategies**]() are used by programming languages to determine two things‚Äîwhen to evaluate the arguments of a function call and what kind of value to pass to the function). That means that when you write some code that appears to apply a function to an expression or expressions, JavaScript evaluates all of those expressions and applies the functions to the resulting value(s).

So when you write:
```js 
((diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265)(1 + 1)
  //=> 6.2831853
```
What happened internally is that the expression `1 + 1` was evaluated first, resulting in 2. Then our circumference function was applied to `2`. 

We‚Äôll see below that while JavaScript always calls by value, the notion of a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù has additional subtlety. But before we do, let‚Äôs look at variables.

## variables and bindings
Right now everything looks simple and straightforward, and we can move on to talk about arguments in more detail. And we‚Äôre going to work our way up from (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 to functions like:
```js
(x) => (y) => x
```
`(x) => (y) => x` just looks crazy, as if we are learning English as a second language and the teacher promises us that soon we will be using words like antidisestablishmentarianism. Besides a desire to use long words to sound impressive, this is not going to seem attractive until we find ourselves wanting to discuss the role of the Church of England in 19th century British politics.

But there‚Äôs another reason for learning the word antidisestablishmentarianism: We might learn how prefixes and postfixes work in English grammar. It‚Äôs the same thing with `(x) => (y) => x`. It has a certain important meaning in its own right, and it‚Äôs also an excellent excuse to learn about functions that make functions, environments, variables, and more.

In order to talk about how this works, we should agree on a few terms (you may already know them, but let‚Äôs check-in together and ‚Äúsynchronize our dictionaries‚Äù). The first x, the one in `(x) => ..`., is an *argument*. The `y` in `function (y) ...` is another *argument*. The second `x`, the one in `=> x`, **is not an argument, it‚Äôs an expression referring to a variable**. Arguments and variables work the same way whether we‚Äôre talking about `(x) => (y) => x` or just plain `(x) => x`.

>- [^ **What is 'invoked' mean? What is an environment?**] Every time a function is [**invoked**]() (‚Äúinvoked‚Äù means ‚Äúapplied to zero or more arguments‚Äù), a new environment is created. An [**environment**]() is a (possibly empty) dictionary that maps variables to values by name. **The `x` in the expression that we call a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù is itself an expression that is evaluated by looking up the value in the environment.**

>- [^ **Can you talk through how a varible might gets its value in an environment? Like what is happening in `((x) => x)(2)`?**] How does the value get put in the environment? Well for arguments, that is very simple. When you apply the function to the arguments, an entry is placed in the dictionary for each argument. So when we write:
```js 
((x) => x)(2)
  //=> 2
```
What happens is this:

1. JavaScript parses this whole thing as an expression made up of several sub-expressions.
2. It then starts evaluating the expression, including evaluating sub-expressions
3. One sub-expression, `(x) => x` evaluates to a function.
4. Another, `2`, evaluates to the number `2`.
5. JavaScript now evaluates applying the function to the argument 2. Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting‚Ä¶
6. An environment is created.
7. The value ‚Äò2‚Äô is bound to the name ‚Äòx‚Äô in the environment.
8. The expression ‚Äòx‚Äô (the right side of the function) is evaluated within the environment we just created.
9. The value of a variable when evaluated in an environment is the value bound to the variable‚Äôs name in that environment, which is ‚Äò2‚Äô
10. And that‚Äôs our result.

When we talk about environments, we‚Äôll use an unsurprising syntax(JSON) for showing their bindings: `{x: 2, ...}`. meaning, that the environment is a dictionary, and that the value 2 is bound to the name x, and that there might be other stuff in that dictionary we aren‚Äôt discussing right now.

## call by sharing
Earlier, we distinguished JavaScript‚Äôs **value types** from its **reference types**. At that time, we looked at how JavaScript distinguishes objects that are identical from objects that are not. Now it is time to take another look at the distinction between value and reference types.

There is a property that JavaScript strictly maintains: When a value‚Äìany value‚Äìis passed as an argument to a function, the value bound in the function‚Äôs environment must be identical to the original.

>- [^ **What does it mean to bind a name to a value?**] We said that JavaScript binds names to values, but we didn‚Äôt say what it means to bind a name to a value. Now we can elaborate: **When JavaScript binds a value-type to a name, it makes a copy of the value and places the copy in the environment. As you recall, value types like strings and numbers are identical to each other if they have the same content. So JavaScript can make as many copies of strings, numbers, or booleans as it wishes.**

>- [^ **What about binding reference types?**]What about reference types? **JavaScript does not place copies of reference values in any environment. JavaScript places *references* to reference types in environments, and when the value needs to be used, JavaScript uses the reference to obtain the original.**

Because many references can share the same value, and because JavaScript passes references as arguments, JavaScript can be said to implement **‚Äúcall by sharing‚Äù** semantics. [**Call by sharing**]() is generally understood to be a specialization of call by value, and it explains why some values are known as value types and other values are known as reference types.

And with that, we‚Äôre ready to look at **closures**. When we combine our knowledge of value types, reference types, arguments, and closures, we‚Äôll understand why this function always evaluates to true no matter what argument you apply it to:
``` 
(value) =>
  ((ref1, ref2) => ref1 === ref2)(value, value)
```
## Key Insights 
- I'm still a bit unclear with this "call-by-sharing" business
- Does this, `(value) => ((ref1, ref2) => ref1 === ref2)(value, value)` always evaluate to `true` because they are referencing the same reference when we pass in objects? 
    - Is it setting up closures because the returned IFEE has closure over the initial function argument `value` which the inner function has reference to as both of it's arguments, therefore referring to the same memory address within the "environment" of the closure?
