## Review Questions
1. What is the backbone of an HTML document?
1. According to the DOM what is every HTML tag?
1. Because all these tags are __________, we can do what with the resulting DOM elements?
1. How does the DOM handle spaces/newlines?
1. What is something to keep in mind when using `<table>` elements?
1. Is a comment considered an element node?
1. How many node elements are there in total, and which 4 do we care most about?

## Summary
An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.

* Tags become element nodes and form the structure.
* Text becomes text nodes.
* …etc, everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.

We can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.

Here we covered the basics, the most used and important actions to start with. There’s an extensive documentation about Chrome Developer Tools at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools. The best way to learn the tools is to click here and there, read menus: most options are obvious. Later, when you know them in general, read the docs and pick up the rest.

DOM nodes have properties and methods that allow us to travel between them, modify them, move around the page, and more. We’ll get down to them in the next chapters.

## DOM tree
>* The backbone of an HTML document is tags.
>* According to the DOM, every HTML tag is an **object**. Nested tags are "children" of the enclosing one. The text inside a tag is an object as well.

>* **All these objects are accesible using JavaScript, and we can use them to modify the page.**

For example, `document.body` is the object representing the `<body>` tag.

Running this code will make the body red for 3 seconds:
```js 
document.body.style.background = "red";

setTimeout(() => documeny.body.stylebackground = "", 3000);
```

## An Example of the DOM
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <title>About elk</title>
</head>
<body>
  The truth about elk.
</body>
</html>
```

- Every tree node is an object
- ***tags*** are *element nodes* (or just elements) and form the tree structure: `<html>` is at the root, and then `<head>` and `<body>` are its children.
- The text inside elements forms *text nodes*. A *text node* contains only a string. It may not have children and is always a leaf of the tree.

Spaces and newlines are totally valid characters, like letters and digits. They form text nodes and become a part of the DOM.

- There are only two top-level exclusions:
  1. Spaces and newlines before `<head>` are ignored for historical reasons.
  2. If we put something after `</body>`, then that is automatically moved inside the body, at the end, as the HTML spec requires that all content must be inside `<body>`. So there can’t be any spaces after `</body>`.
  In other cases everything’s straightforward – if there are spaces (just like any character) in the document, then they become text nodes in the DOM, and if we remove them, then there won’t be any.

Here are no space-only text nodes:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html><head><title>About elk</title></head><body>The truth about elk.</body></html>
```

## Autocorrection
- If the browser encounters malformed HTML, it automatically corrects it when making the DOM.
- While generating the DOM, browsers automatically process errors in the document, close tags and so on.
- A document with unclosed tags …will become a normal DOM as the browser reads tags and restores the missing parts:

⚠️ Tables always have `<tbody>`
An interesting “special case” is tables. By the DOM specification they must have `<tbody>`, but HTML text may (officially) omit it. Then the browser creates `<tbody>` in the DOM automatically.

## Other node types
**comment nodes** are a type of a node.

We may think – why is a comment added to the DOM? It doesn’t affect the visual representation in any way. But there’s a rule – if something’s in HTML, then it also must be in the DOM tree.

>* **Everything in HTML, even comments, becomes a part of the DOM.**

Even the `<!DOCTYPE...>` directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node. We are not going to touch that node, we even don’t draw it on diagrams for that reason, but it’s there.

The `document` object that represents the whole document is, formally, a DOM node as well.

>* There are 12 node types. In practice we usually work with 4 of them:  
>   1. `document` – the “entry point” into DOM.
>   2. **element nodes** – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
>   3. **text nodes** – contain text.
>   4. **comments** – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.
