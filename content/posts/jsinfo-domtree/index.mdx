## Summary
An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.

* Tags become element nodes and form the structure.
* Text becomes text nodes.
* …etc, everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.

We can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.

Here we covered the basics, the most used and important actions to start with. There’s an extensive documentation about Chrome Developer Tools at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools. The best way to learn the tools is to click here and there, read menus: most options are obvious. Later, when you know them in general, read the docs and pick up the rest.

DOM nodes have properties and methods that allow us to travel between them, modify them, move around the page, and more. We’ll get down to them in the next chapters.

## DOM tree
- The backbone of an HTML document is tags.
- According to the DOM, every HTML tag is an **object**. Nested tags are "children" of the enclosing one. The text inside a tag is an object as well.

* **All these objects are accesible using JavaScript, and we can use them to modify the page.**

For example, `document.body` is the object representing the `<body>` tag.

Running this code will make the body red for 3 seconds:
```js 
document.body.style.background = "red";

setTimeout(() => documeny.body.stylebackground = "", 3000);
```
