- CSS provides a wide variety of unit options to choose from. Pixels are one such option.
- Pixels are known as [**absolute units**](), that is 5px always means the same thing.
- Other units such as ems are not absolute but rather [**relative units**](), where their value changes based on external factors. 
- many devs uncertain about ems acting predictably, by the end of this we will have removed the mysterious of their expected values. 

## The power of relative values 
CSS brings a *late-binding* of styles to the web page: The content of and its styles aren't pulled together until after the authoring of both is complete. The web is a place that is no longer like a traditional publishing house or early computer application develoment where there were fixed sizes of things. In the web, things/windows and especially with mobile, can be adjusted/variable between users. 

### The struggle for pixel-perfect design 
For a long time, designers mitigated complexity of adjustable/variable screen sizes by focusing on "pixel-perfect" designs (think Web 2.0). They'd create a tightly defined container, often a centered column around 800px wide and design within those contraints. 

### The end of pixel-perfect web 
Laptops, and smartphones changed the game on locking in on ideal/singular page/view presentations, and thus began the emergence of [**responsive design**](), in CSS this rewfers to styles that "respond" differently based on the size of the browser window. 

- Added abstraction means additional complexity. As you write your CSS, you need to be able to think simultaneously in specifics, as well as in generalities. 
    - When you've multiple ways to do something, side with way that works more generally under multiple circumstances.
- *Relative units* are one of the tools CSS provides to work at this level of abstraction.

### Pixels, points, and picas 
- pixels, `px` 
- millimeters, `mm` 
- 

Pixel is a slightly misleading name, a CSS pixel != a monitor pixel, notably in the case of "retina" displays. 

## Ems and rems 
### Using ems to define font-size 

### Using rems for font-size 

## Stop thinking in pixels 

### Setting a sane default font-size 

### Resizing a single component 

## Viewport-relative units 

### Using `vw` for font size 

### Using `calc()` for font size 

## Unitless numbers and line-height 

## Custom properties (aka CSS variables)

### Changing custom properties dynamically 
### Changing custom properties with JavaScript 
### Experimenting with custom properties 


## Summary 
- Embrace the use of relative units, allowing the page's structure to determien the meaning of your styles.
- Favor the use of rems for font size, but selectively use ems for simple scaling of components on the page.
- You can make your entire page scale responsively without any media queries. 
- Use unitless values when specifying line heights 
- You can start getting familiar with one of CSS's newest features, custom properties.
