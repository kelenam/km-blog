# Performance Part 1

## Introduction to Performance Part 1
- Good performance is pretty important, seconds matter.
- Client --> Server
    get request to server
    server returns file
    - makes further requests based on needs, styles, images, js files, etc,
    - all requests made by client ping server with requests as they emerge
- Your page should load in less than 2 seconds otherwise you will lose a lot of visitors

## 3 Keys to Performance

3 ways to improve performance, can work on all 3. But you need to know what/where bottlenecks are, you need benchmarks to be efficient with your focus.

1) Front-end
    - Critical render path
    - optimzed code
    - Progressive web app
2) Middle / Transfer
    - Minimize Files
    - Minimize Delivery
3) Backend
    - CDNS
    - Caching
    - Load Balance
    - DB Scaling
    - GZip

## Network Performance

### Honey I shrunk the files
- bigger files = longer load
- Minimize text (uglifyJS --> minimizes JS,CSS,HTML; part of a build process, included in webpack)
- Minimze Images (optimize, often easiest to improve speed, but often mis-performed)
- https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/images-done-right-web-graphics-good-to-the-last-byte-optimization-techniques

### Image File Formats
- easier: change file format to easier, JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG,
- each has specific use case
- JPG: Complex Photos images, thigns with lots of color, no transparency allowed, tend to be big
- GIF: limit colors, grainy, small animations, 
- PNGS: limit colors, smaller than JPGS because of that, used for logos, have transparency
- SVG: vector graphics, expand size without loss of resolution, really small, and customizeable with css
- Make sure format matches needs, then compress/optimize

### Image Optimizations
- If you want transparency: use a PNG
- If you want animations: gif
- colorful images: jpg
- simple icons, logos, illustrations: SVGs

### Minimize
- Reduce PNG with : TinyPNG
- Reduce JPG with: JPEG-optimizer
- Try to choose simple ullustrations over highly detailed photographs
- Always lower JPEG image quality (30-60%)
- Resize image based on size it will be displayed
- Display different sized iamges for different backgrounds.
- Use CDNs like imgix
- Remove image metadata

### Media Queries
- media queries useful for resizing appropriate image sizes for device
- must save different file sizes, and just use css and media queries to serve smaller versions based on device size. 
- browswer smart enough to know to download only assets it needs at a given time

 ### CDNS
- CDNS, take unoptimized images, and optimizes, caches it and gives you a url, 
- verefix.com removes saved metadata of photos.

### The Traveling DeliveryMan

- reducing the amount of trips the deliveryman takes
- sending only what we need down the wire.
- lightweight libraries. 
- Minimize number of files and number of requests

### Critical Render Path 

- HTML file arrives in browser from server
    - Browser than starts reading or parsing HTML it generates the tree model known as the DOM.
    - when rendering DOM it encounter CSS and requests
    - Once DOM generated, starts working on COM (CSS Object Model) trees nodes for content style nodes
    - Then sees JS file and sees any changes to the DOM it must make, then it rerenders DOM with combined render tree
    - Render tree determines layout.
    - Images are actually not part of this process and requested at need basis.

### Render Tree 



```
              DOMContentLoaded                  Load
                 |                               |
                 V                               V              
DOM --> CSSOM --> Render Tree --> Layout --> Paint
HTML
    CSS          JS                             JS
    JS
```
- Parses HTML, creates DOM, as it sees external resources and DLs them as need be.
- CSS and JS take higher priority than images.
- Get CSS to browser as soon as possible.
- JS at bottom of file because scripts will be blocking rest of render.
    - exceptions might be GA (or tracking inclusions)

- Script tags at bottom, bottom of body tag
- style tags higher, bottom of head.

### Critical Render Path 2 (CSS)
- CSS is considered render blocking 
    - CSSOM must finish before Render Tree generated
    - Therefore keep CSS:
        - Only load whatever is needed
        - Above the fold loading
            - Can write a function that pulls in style file only when needed.
        - Media Attributes
        - Less specificity
            - More work with deeper specificity
    
### Critical Render Path 3 (JS)
- JS files problem worse because they can both modify HTML and CSS, the DOM and the CSSOM after everything is loaded. Has to go back and modify before Render Tree produced
- Remember JS is parser blocking.

- A few things we can do:
    - Load scripts asynchronously
    - Defer Loading of scripts
    - Minimze DOM Manipulating
    - Avoid long running JS

- `<script>`: **Use for critical scripts and app scripts**

- `<script async>`: **Use for third-party scripts that don't effect DOM**
    - might produce errors if we are modifiying the DOM and in this file and the DOM has finished loading.
    - Rule for use is: Add them to anything that doesn't affect the DOM or CSSOM
    - Use for all eternal scripts that require no knowledge of our code, stuff non-essnetially to our UI (tracking, GA scripts,)

- `<script defer>`: **Any third-party scripts not that important for above fold**
    - Defers loading of scripts, will not block loading, but will load only after HTML has completely finished loading.
    - Good for things that will act on DOM/Render Tree, but for stuff not-important with above the fold content

** Different browsers handle these script attributes differently.
- the location of the script tags when you put async  or defer  attributes on them is important: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10808109/script-tag-async-defer

### Critical Render Path 4 
- JS Events at the end of load will cause redraw of the render-tree
- Limit the under-performant DOM manipulating events

### Review
- HTML
    - Load style tag in the `<head>`
    - Load the script tag before `</body>`

- CSS 
    - Only load whatever is needed
    - Above the fold loading
    - Media Attributes
    - Less Specificity

- JS 
    - Load Scripts asyncrhonously
    - Defer loading of scripts
    - Minimze DOM Manipulating
    - Avoid long running JS


### Resources: Performance Tools
#### Resources: Performance Tools

Here are some extra resources and guides if you want a little more practice:

#### Exercise: Dev Tools: 

- [View main thread activities in a table](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#activities) to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.
- [Analyze frames per second (FPS)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#fps) to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.  
- [Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/devtools-release-notes#perf-monitor) in real-time with the Performance Monitor.  
- [Capture screenshots while recording](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#screenshots) to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an animation fired, and so on.  
- [View interactions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#interactions) to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.
- [Find scroll performance issues in real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#paint-flashing) by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.  
- [View paint events in real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#main) to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your animations.  
- [View main thread activity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#main) to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.

- [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/): One of several good browser-based tools that gives you lots of options for cropping, rotating, resizing, adding effects to, and converting images.

### HTTP/2
- May change how you decide on combining resources
- multiplexing might make bundling files as efficient
- one connection for parallelism, and concurrent file processing.
- also has something called server push

You can actually specify in node with http2 module to create a program using the HTTP/2 Protocol...
resource: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/

```js
const http2 = require('http2');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
    key: fs.readFileSync('./selfsigned.key');
    cert: fs.readFileSync('./selfseigned.crt');
    allowHTTP1: true
}

const server = http2.createSecureServer(options, (req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
    res.end('ok');
});
```
### Section Summary
- "Preoptimization is the root of all evil"
- Everything a trade-off, keep big picture in mind.
