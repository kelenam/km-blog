Someone who can build an application from start to finish, basic definition of full stack engineer

## Why Full Stack
- at some point in your career you are going to encounter these things
- UI engineers are easy/plentiful, b/c you can just open up a browser and get coding
- knowing backend makes you a better engineer, widens your skillset. 

## Command Line Overview
### Why the conmmand line?
- fast 
- consistent 
- easier to automate, scripts, etc.
- powerful
- ubiquitous

## Command Line Practice
- `cd`- change directory
- `ls` - list directory contents
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `rmdir` - remove directory

- `cat` - show file contents 
- `man` - command manual
- `less` - show file contents by page 
- `rm` - remove file 
- `echo` - repeat input 

## Shells
- Bash is one 

**Shell**: command interpreter to interface with system
**Terminal**: Runs shell applications (wrappers around shells, like zsh, iterm2)
```
shell --> application --> kernel 
```
- `echo $0` : will tell you which terminal you're in,
