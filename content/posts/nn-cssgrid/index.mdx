## Review Questions

## Why Use CSS Grid?
We used to use hacky floats and empty div spaces.

To improve upon this was Flexbox, but now without its drawbacks. Flexbox is really only good in one direction, either row direction or column direction. You can't really use it in the same direction at once.
- We would also have to use extra markup if we wanted to nest these flex items.
- We can get around all of this by using *CSS Grid*

CSS Grid makes it easy to make responsive web pages, and it looks something like this:
```html 
<div id="content">

    <header>Header</header>

    <main>Main</main>

    <aside>Aside</aside>

    <nav>Nav</nav>

    <footer>Footer</footer>

</div>
```
Here is the html to accomplish the layout below. It's simple without the need of having any nested elements html elements.
