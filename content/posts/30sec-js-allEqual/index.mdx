### allEqual
`allEqual` checks if all elements in an array are equal.

Use `Array.prototype.every()` to check if all the elements of the array are the same as the first one. Elements are compared using the strict comparison operator, which does not account for `NaN` self-inequality.

```js
const allEqual = arr => arr.every(val => val === arr[0]);

// Examples
allEqual([1,2,3,4,5,6]); // --> false
allEqual([1,1,1,1,1,1]); // --> True
```

### Why/When might we use this?
Perhaps as a more specific use-case alternative to [`all`](/30sec-js-all) where instead of defining the predicate behavior, we are simply looking for equality across a set.  
Maybe in a situation where we are using this to bridge some ensuing action, like, gathering test results, we have an array of passing tests that are all supposed to be `true`. If all tests are passing then something else can proceed, the `allEqual` function can serve as a mini-validation step.
