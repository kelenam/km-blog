### Contents 
- Basic principles of PHP 
- PHP7 / Apache / MySQL Setup 
- Code Syntax (vars, arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, etc)
- Procedural & OOP 
- Dynamic Pages 
- Form Submission / Superglobals 
- Working with Databases 
- Mini Projects (Contact Form, User Login System, etc)

Need a server to run. Going to be using XAMP but you can use LAMP stack. 

### What is PHP?
- PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (Recusive Acronym)
- Server Side Programming / Scripting Language 
    - All code must be hosted on a server, Apache is the most common server for it to be run. 
    - LAMP stack is Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. Really popular stack to work with.
- Can be embedded direcdtly within HTML (<?php?>) (one of the huge advantages of PHP)
- Files use a ".php" file extension 

### How Does PHP Work? 
- Client makes a request 
- Server runs PHP (via an interpreter) / extensions 
    - while being processeed it has the ability to work with a database 
- Query database if needed 
- Load other files if needed 
- Result is sent back to client 
    - doesn't work like an HTML page, where it sends the HTML down to the client
    - PHP simply sends the result of its code back, usually it is HTML, but it can also be plaintext, XML, JSON, PDF, etc.

### Why Use PHP?
- easy to learn 
    - untyped Language
- free and open source 
- great support 
- cross platform
- freedom (can get some devs into trouble)
- frameworks 
- Database compatibility

### What Can PHP Do? 
- Create dynamic page content 
- intertact with files on teh server 
- collectc and process forms 
- send / receive cookies 
- interact with databases 
- access control 
- encrypt data 
- almost anything else 

### What can you build with php?
- basic websites 
- blog types websites 
- shopping carts 
- social networks 
- content management systems 
- memebership websites 
- search engines 
- backend APIs 

### Installation 
When we first install PHP, we need run .exe as admin, to allow us to run modules as service like Apache, and MySQL in the background.

Now once enabled, we can navigate to localhost in a browswer and it will redirect us to the dashboard that sets it up for us. 


Loads this `index.php` like an html file, we can just change the php contents of this file to have it echo 'Hello, World' if we like. 

- When XAMPP running, you can navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin to go to the php myadmin database. 
- The first thing we want to do is add a password because, as you can see its freely accessible, and we want to be more secure.
    - User accounts > root localhost > Edit Privileges > Change Password 
    - change password, hit go, if we navigate back towaards databases we will get a bunch of errors 
    - we have to edit our config file to add the password, in config.inc.php within the phphmyadmin directory.
    - Now when we use mySQL in our script we'll have to use this password.

## Variables, Constants & Data Types 
We will create a phpsandbox folder in our htdocs folder to store our coures code examples.  

Create a new file called `variables.php` type in 'hello' and save, we can access this filein the browswer by navigating to `http://localhost/phpsandbox/variables.php` and we will see hello in the browswer. HTML would get parsed as well, but if we want to use php we have to wrap php code in php tags: `<?php ?>`

- Some developers will leave out the ending `?>` tag, and so long as you don't have html within the php tag it shouldn't cause a problem, but it's your preference to keep the closing php tag. 

```php 
<?php 
    echo 'Hello World';
?>
```
- `echo` will just echo the text, we could even wrap the echo in `h1` tags or html, so long as we have the closing php tag if we are using html inside. 

```php 
<h1><?php 
    echo 'Hello World';
?></h1>
``` 
- `print` would do the same, but the difference between `echo` and `print` is that `print` will actually return the value and can be used with expressions where `echo` doesn't and therefore is a bit faster. 

### Comments
Three ways to do it in PHP, 
```php 
    // Single line comment 
    # Single line comment 
    /*
        Multiline comment 
    */
```

### Variables 
```php 
    // Single line comment 
    # Single line comment 
    /*
        Multiline comment 
    */
    $output = 'Hello World!';
    echo $output;
```
Rules for variables in PHP:

- Prefix $ 
- start with a letter or an underscore (underscore is the only character allowed besides numbers and letters, you can start with an underscore but can't start with a number)
- Only letters, numbers, and underscores 
- case sensitive 

### Data Types 
- String
- Integers 
- floats 
- Booleans 
- Arrays 
- Objects 
- NULL 
- Resource (can be a reference to a function, not an actual datatype)

```php 
#DATA TYPES 
/*
    String
    Integer
    Float
    Boolean
    Array 
    Object
    NULL 
    Resource
*/
    $output = 'Hello World!';
    $num1 = 4;
    $num2 = 10;
    
    $float1 = 4.4;
    $bool1 = true;
    echo $output
```
- String concatenation is different in PHP in that it uses `.` instead of `+`, e.g. `$string1 + $string2` would work in JS, but not in PHP, instead it would need to be `$string . $string`, if we wanted a aspace we could do, `$string1 .' '. $string2`. 

The different between double quotes and single quotes is that double quotes actually parse varibles, so instead of the above we could simply do `$greeting = "$string1 $string2!";`

### Escape sequences 

```php 
    $string3 = 'They\'re Here'; 
```
For things like aspostrophes, we can escape it by prefixing with backslash, `\`. You only need to escape it if the surrounding quotes are interupted.

### Constants 
You should only use constants if you know for sure the value associated with it isn't going to change. 
To create constants you have to use the `define()` function. The convention is to keep the name all uppercase.
```php 
define('GREETING', 'Hello Everyone', true);
```
Constants are case sensitive by default, if you want them to be case insensitive, you can add a third parameter to the `define` function, by passing it `true`...

## Arrays 
- Arrays are variables that holds multiple values
- Basically three types 
    - Indexed 
    - Associative 
    - Multi-dimensional 


### Indexed Arrays  
```php 
    // Indexed 
    $people = array('Kevin', 'Jeremy', 'Sara');
    echo $people[1];
    // --> Jeremy 

    # Second way for arrays 
    $cars = ['Honda', 'Toyota', 'Ford'];
```
- Adding to arrays is easy, `$cars[3] = 'Chevy'`.
- ‚≠êIn some cases, you can may not know the length of the array, so you could simply say: `$cars[] = 'Chevy'` 

A bunch of different array functions in PHP. `count()` for instance... `echo count($cars)` will echo out the count of 

- `print_r($cars)` will print out all things in the array, helpful for arrays 
- `var_dump($cars)` will show us the whole array and the data type and the number of characters. Pretty helpful, not just for arrays, but also for any data type. 

### Associative Arays 
Allows you to define a key and an index. We can assign a key to whatever we want and to whatever data type we want...
```php
<?php
$people = array('Brad' => 35, 'Jose' => 32, 'William' => 37);
echo $people['Brad'];
$ids = [22 => 'Brad', 44 => 'Jose', 63 => 'William'];
echo $ids[22];

$people['Jill'] = 42;
print_r($people)
```
- Kind of similar to JS Objects
- Adding to arrays is easy, we can just add specify a key and a value. 

### Mulidimensional
Array within an array 
```php 
<?php
$cars = array(
    array('Honda', 20, 10);
    array('Toyota', 30, 20);
    array('Ford', 23, 12);
);
echo $cars[1][0];
```
- The first index is where in the first array, the next would be the index within the subarray.

## Loops 
- Four different types of loops in PHP: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `foreach`
```php 
<?php
# For loop
# @params - init, condition, increment 
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; i++) {
    echo $i;
}
```
- Usually `for` loop used if you know number of times it will be executed

### while loop 
```php 
<?php
# While loop
# @params - condition 

$i = 0;
while ($i <10) {
    echo $i;
    echo '<br>';
    $i++;
}
```
- variable increment defined outside of the loop 
- used over a `for` loop if you don't know the set condition 

### do... while
- brad rarely uses them
```php 
<?php
# Do... While loop
# @params - condition 
$i = 0;
do {
    echo $i;
    echo '<br>';
    $i++;
}


while($i <10);

```
- Always going to run at least once no matter what 

### `foreach` loop 
- `foreach` is used for arrays 
```php 
<?php
# foreach loop - for arrays 
$people = array('brad', 'jose', 'william');
for($people as $person) {
    echo $person;
    echo '<br>';
}

# foreach for associative arrays 

$people = array('brad' => 'brad@mail.com', 'jose' => 'jose@mail.com', 'william' => 'will@mail.com');
foreach$people as $person => $email) {
    echo $person.': '.$email;
    echo '<br>';
}
```
- you want to use a variable for whatever the singular form of the array name is 
- the format for looping through associative arrays is you provide variables names for both the keys and the values similar to declaring keys/values with associative arrays, with the `=>` fat arrow syntax.

## Functions 
A review of naming conventions: camelCase, lower_case, PascalCase. In PHP camel case is usually used, Pascal case usually used for objects. (Similar to JS), different frameworks use different styles of this, Codeigniter uses lower_case style. 
- camelCase : myFunction() 
- lower_case: my_function();
- Pascal_case: MyFunction();
```php
<?php 
    # FUNCTION - block of code that can be repeatedly called

    // Create Simple function 
    function simpleFunction() {
        echo 'Hello World';
    }
    // Run simple function 
    simpleFunction();

    // Function with Param 
    function sayHello($name = 'World') {
        echo "Hello $name<br>";
    }

    sayHello('Joe');
    sayHello('Bob');

    function addNumbers($num1, $num2) {
        return $num1 + $num2;
    }

    echo addNumbers(2,3);
?>
```
- Function syntax very similar to JS, 
- You can include parameters/arguments 
- You can provide default argument values like you would in js; `$name = 'World'` 
- You can also return values from functions, which is typically what you want to do 

### Passing arguments by reference 
Normally if we have a variable like `$myNum = 10` it will pass it in by value, `10`, if we want to pass it in by reference...
```php 
<?php 
function addFive($num) {
    $num += 5;
}

function addTen(&$num) {
    $num += 10;
}

addFive($muNum);

echo "Value: $myNum<br>";

addTen($myNum);

echo "Value: $muNum<br>"
```
- By placing an `&` ampersand in front of the variable name we are passing it in by reference instead of value, that means we are mutating that specific variable reference.  
- Brad doesn't use pass by reference very much in his own code 

## Conditionals & Comparison
Useful for comparing values, conditions, etc.
```php 
<?php 

    # CONDITIONALS

    /*
        ==
        ===
        <
        >
        <=
        >=
        != 
        !== 
    */
    $num = 6;

    if($num === 5) {
        echo '5 passed';
    } elseif($num == 6) {
        echo '6 passed';
    } else {
        echo 'did not pass';
    }

    # NESTING IF 
    $num = 5; 
    if($num < 5) {
        if($num > 10) {
            echo "$num passed";
        } 
    }

    /* 
        LOGICAL OPERATORS 
        AND &&
        OR ||
        xor 
    */

    if ($num > 4 XOR $num <10) {
        echo "$num passed";
    }

``` 
- You can also nest if statements 
- Better to use logical operators over nested if statements if possible 
- xor is 'exclusive or', one of them has to be true but not both.
- Logical operators in PHP, you can use `AND` or `&&`. `OR` or `||` 

### Switches 
```php 
<?php 

    # SWITCH 
    $favColor = 'red';

    switch($favColor) {
        case 'red': 
            echo 'Your favorite color is red';
            break;
        case 'blue': 
            echo 'Your favorite color is blue';
            break;
        case 'green': 
            echo 'Your favorite color is green';
            break;
        default: 
            echo 'Your favorite color is something else';
    }
```
- add `break` after whatever case you want.

## Dates & Timestamps 
```php 
<?php 

echo date('d'); // Will give us the number of the day
echo date('m'); // Month 
echo date('Y'); // Year 

echo date('l'); // Day of the week 

echo date('Y/m/d');
echo date('m-d-y');
echo date('h'); // Hour 
echo date('i'); // Minute 
echo date('s'); // SEconds 
echo date('a'); // AM/PM

echo date('h:i:sa');

// Set timezone
date_default_timezone_set('America/Los_Angeles');
```
- ‚≠ê For year you need to give an uppercase `Y`.
- lowercase `l` will give us day of the week 
- You can combine them which is what you want to do.
- `h` for hour (might be wrong )
- `i` for minutes 
- `a` for AM/PM 
- Can also combine time things together. 

If your clock is off, you might need to set the timezone for your environemtn or XAMPP setup. 
You can do that with `date_default_timezone_set()`

### Making time/timestamps 
```php 
<?php 
// Hours, minutes, seconds, month, day, year 
$timestamp = mktime(10, 14, 54, 9, 10, 1981);
echo $timestamp; // Will give a string of numbers -> 368978294 

echo date('m/d/Y h:i:sa', $timestamp);
```
- You can use the function `mktime` to make a timestamp 
- a unix timestamp is just an integer containing the number of seconds between the unix epoch and the time specified; 
- So the `date` function can also take another argument, a timestamp to be converted into a readable date. 

### `strtotime` 
```php 
<?php 
    $timestamp2 = strtotime('7:00pm March 22 2016');
    echo $timestamp2;
    echo date('m/d/Y h:i:sa', $timestamp2)

    $timestamp3 = strtotime('tomorrow');
    echo date('m/d/Y h:i:sa', $timestamp3);

    $timestamp4 = strtotime('next Sunday');
    echo date('m/d/Y h:i:sa', $timestamp4);

``` 
- the string we pass in is very specific but can be vague if we want it to be like `$timestamp3` and `$timestamp4`
- We can also do two months from now with `+2 Months`
- If you want to learn more you can go to the PHP docs, php.net data.php 

## include and require statements 
These allow us to insert PHP code/markup/text into another PHP file and saves a ton of time writing out a bunch of code 
```php 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.php">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.php">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.php">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Contact</h1>

    <footer>
        <p>Mywebsite &copy; 2020</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
- So we can copy this code for the other files, contact and about, and we have all this repeated code with only one thing changing, the h1. We can save a lot of time by using includes/requires 
- `inc` folder within a php project is common that just stands for includes, create a `header.php` within the includes 
- In the `index.php` file you can cut everything above the `h1` and put in `header.php` file, then take everything below the h1 and put it in the footer file. Then, over in your `index.php` file which will only have the h1 you can do something like this ...

```php:tile=index.php
<?php include 'inc/header.php'; ?>
    <h1>Home</h1>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
```
- You can then do the same thing for the About/Contact pages.
- If we included a file that isn't there 

### The difference between `include` and `require`
The difference between the two is if `require` won't continue the script if the file is not found, `include` will continue.
If you want to halt the rest of the files from loading use `require`, if you want it to keep going regardless use `include` 

- `require_once` will check to see if its already been required, if it has it won't again. 
- You can also use the function format: `include('inc/header.php') ?>`

## $_SERVER Superglobal 
Superglobals are bulit in variables that are always available in all scopes, can be accessed from anywhere. Basically system variables. 

We will start with $_SERVER which will address client info/browser info, and anything related to the server. 

The `$_SERVER` superglobal is an associative array and we can access things on it like we would a normal array.

```php 
 <?php 
    # $_SERVER SUPERGLOBAL 
    // Create Server Array 
    $server = [
        'Host Server Name' => $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'],
        'Host Header' => $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'],
        'Server Software' => $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE'],
        'Document Root' => $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'],
        'Current Page' => $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],
        'Script Name' => $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'],
        'Absolute Path' => $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']
    ];
    echo $server['Host Server Name'];
    // -> localhost 
    echo $server['Host Header'];
    // -> localhost 
    echo $server['Server Software'];

    print_r($server);
 ?>
```
- ‚≠ê Something we might use often is `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];`
- ‚≠ê Another useful property can be useful (especially for form submissions is `PHP_SELF`), for submitting to same page you are on, 
- Some of these could be the same like current page and script name, 
- you can grab absolute path with `SCRIPT_FILENAME`
- The code above is most of these server properties, you can check out more in the PHP docs 

### Client Array 
```php 
 <?php 
    # Create Client Array 
    $client = [
        'Client System Info' => $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],
        'Client IP' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'],
        'Remote Port' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_PORT']
    ];

    print_r($client);
 ?>
```

### PHP Shorthand syntax 
- There is a PHP shorthand syntax for if/loops/etc if you're using php within html that ends with a colon, and ends the php closing tag...

```php 
<?php if($server): ?>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <?php foreach($server as $key => $value): ?>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong><?php echo $key; ?>: </strong>
                <?php echo $value; ?>
            </li>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```
We also want to do the same for the client stuff, 

### Build our Page
```php 
<?php include 'server-info.php'; ?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Client Info</h1>
        <?php if($server): ?>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <?php foreach($server as $key => $value): ?>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong><?php echo $key; ?>: </strong>
                        <?php echo $value; ?>
                    </li>
                <?php endforeach; ?>
            </ul>
        <?php endif; ?>

        <br>

        <h1>Client Info</h1>
        <?php if($client): ?>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <?php foreach($client as $key => $value): ?>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong><?php echo $key; ?>: </strong>
                        <?php echo $value; ?>
                    </li>
                <?php endforeach; ?>
            </ul>
        <?php endif; ?>

    </div>
</body>
</html>
```  

## GET & POST 
When you submit a form to a server/php page you can send data using the GET or POST method. 
- The GET method you are actually sending the data through the URL, you can do so with query strings but its insecure because you are sending 
- Sending data with a POST request is safer because it does through the HTTP headers, safer. 
```php:title=get_post.php
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['name'])) {
        print_r($_GET);
    }
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>

    <form method="GET" action="get_post.php">
        <div>
            <label for="">Name</label>
            <input type="text" name="name">
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="Email">Email</label>
            <input type="text" name="email">
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
- The `name` attribute on our form is really important because its that attribute that we can hook onto from the ,server, to get that data submitted, 
- In order for us to process our form we need to add two things:
    - `method="GET"` 
    - `action="page-to-submit-to.php" `
- If we run this as is, we will get an error because we haven't submitted the form yet, so we need to check to see if its exists first. 
    - we can't just run a normal if, we have to wrap if in a PHP function called `isset` which will check to see if a value is set. 
- When working with any kind of user data you have security issues, one of them  with PHP is XSS attacks, inserting scripts in forms. 

### XSS 
- Cross site scripting attacks 
- If you insert a script tag within the form, you could auto-insert an html/js script, inserted into our form if we are trying to echo to the page. To prevent this from working we can use a function called html entitites, that takes the power out of html tags, take the power out of the opening and closing angled brackets...

```php 
    echo htmlentities($_GET['name']);
```

### POST 
If you don't want to have data be visible through the url like with `GET` than you'll want to use `POST` 
```php:title=get_post.php
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['name'])) {
        echo $_GET['name'];
    }

    if(isset($_POST['name'])){
        $name = htmlentities($_POST['name']);
        echo $name;

        <div>
            <label for="Email">Email</label>

- Now if you check the URL, the data will have been sent through the headers and not through the URL. 

### Third way of getting data 
There is a third way of getting data and that is through a request.
```php:title=get_post.php
<?php
    // if(isset($_GET['name'])) {
    //     echo $_GET['name'];
    // }

    // if(isset($_POST['name'])){
    //     $name = htmlentities($_POST['name']);
    //     echo $name; 
    // }

    if(isset($_REQUEST['name'])){
        $name = htmlentities($_REQUEST ['name']);
        echo $name; 
    }

?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>

    <form method="POST" action="get_post.php">
        <div>
            <label for="">Name</label>
            <input type="text" name="name">
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="Email">Email</label>
            <input type="text" name="email">
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
- `REQUEST` is going to work if the form method is either `POST` or `GET`. 
- `REQUEST` isn't used too much so you should stick with either GET or POST 

### `QUERY_STRING` 
There is another super global which is the QUERY_STRING value.  
`echo $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`

### Sending query strings without forms 
You can send query strings without using a form. 
```php:title=get_post.php
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['name'])) {
        $name = htmlentitiets($_GET['name']);
        echo $name;
    }
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>

    <form method="GET" action="get_post.php">
        <div>
            <label for="">Name</label>
            <input type="text" name="name">
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="Email">Email</label>
            <input type="text" name="email">
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="get_post.php?name=Brad">Brad</a>
        </li>
           <li>
            <a href="get_post.php?name=Brad">Brad</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

## Common String Functions 
- `substr` will return a portion of a string 
```php 
<?php 
    # substr() 
    # Returns a portion of a string 
    $output = substr('Hello', -2);
    echo $output;
    // -> lo 

    # strlen()
    # Returns the length of a string 
    $output = strlen('Hello World');
    echo $output;
    // -> 11 

    #strpos()
    # Finds the position of the first occurence of a substring 
    $output = strpos('Hello World', 'o');
    echo $output;
    // -> 4

    # strrpos()
    # Finds the position of the last occurence of a substring 
    $output = strrpos('Hello World', 'o');
    echo $output;
    // -> 7

    # trim() 
    # Strips whitespace 
    $text = 'Hello World                ';
    var_dump($text);
    // -> string(25) "Hello World"
    // Counting all the spaces after Hello World

    $trimmed = trim($text);
    var_dump($trimmed);

    # strtoupper() 
    # Makes everything uppercase 
    $output = strtoupper('Hello World');
    echo $output;

    # strtolower() 
    # Makes everything lowercase 
    $output = strtolower('Hello World');
    
    # ucwords()
    # Caps first letter of each word
    $output = ucwords('hello world ');
    echo $output; 
    //-> Hello World 

    # str_replace()
    # Replace all occurences of a search string with a replacement 
    $text = 'Hello World';
    $output = str_replace('World', 'Everyone', $text);
    echo $ouput;
    // -> Hello Everyone 

    # is_string()
    # Check if string 
    $val = 'Hello';
    $ouput = is_string($val);
    echo output;
    // -> 1

    $values = array(true, false, null, 'abc', 33, '33', 22.4, '22.4', '', ' ', 0, '0');
    foreach($values as $value){
        if (is_string($value)){
            echo "{$value} is a string<br>"
        }
    }
    
    #gzcompress() 
    # Compress a string 
    $string = "lorem ipsum very long string..."

    $compressed = gzcompress($string);
    echo $compressed;
    // -> unreadable compressed text 
    // useful for compression

    // to uncompress 
    $original = gzuncompress($compressed);
```
- In our substring we pass the string we want to make a substring of as the first arg, we pass a second arg specifying start position, the 3rd is where to end, th
- Using negative numbers will start from the back of the string.
- `strpos` versus `strrpos`, the two rs, the latter finds the last occurence.
- use `trim()` typically with form inputs to trim any user inputed whitespace 
-  `str_replace()` takes 3 parameters: the 1st is the string to be replaced, the 2nd is the str to replace with, the 3rd parameter is the string to search.
- for `is_string` we get a `1` as a return value for true, we get nothing when its false, its ignored.
    - why isn't this a 0 or false? 

## Ternary & Shorthand Syntax 
```php 
<?php 
    # Normal if statement  
    $loggedIn = true;

    if($loggedIn) {
        echo 'You are logged in';   
    } else {
        echo 'You are not logged in';
    }
```
We can save ourselves a few lines by putting the above one a single line ...
```php
<?php 
    # shorthands 
    echo ($loggedIn) ? 'You are logged in' : 'You are not logged in';
```
- Ternary works very similar to JS 
- You can also assign variables based on conditions

```php
<?php 
    # shorthands 
    $isRegistered = ($loggedIn == true) ? true : false;
    echo $isRegistered;
```
- We can also nest these statements 

```php
<?php 
    # shorthands 
    $isRegistered = ($loggedIn == true) ? true : false;
    echo $isRegistered;

    $age = 20;
    $score = 15;

    echo 'Your score is: '.($score > 10 ? ($age > 10 ? 'Average': 'Exceptional'):($age > 10 ? 'Horrible': 'Average'));
```

## Alternative Syntax 
Usually used when embedding statements inside of html 

Here is the regular way first...
```php
<?php 
    <div>
    <?php if($loggedIn) { ?>
        <h1>Welcome User</h1>
    <?php ? ?>
    </div>
```

## Key Insights
- Interesting how the pass by reference option with the & helped me clarify the pass by reference/value in other langs more clearly. It

- `print_r` and `var_dump` helpful for debugging

### Shorthand syntax for conditionals/loops within markdown 
> ‚≠ê You can use the syntax `<?php if(condition): ?>` /* markdown */ `<?php endif; ?>` to wrap html within a php condition, you can do the same with things like foreach...

### isset 
- `isset` is a function that can wraps the condition value of an `if` statement to check if a value has been set, it is a required PHP function if you are checking to see if something from a form has been set: `if(isset($_GET['name']))`

### XSS 
- `htmlentitites()` super important function when dealing with security in PHP and dealing with content a user can submit to the server.
