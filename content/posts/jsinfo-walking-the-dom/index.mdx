## Summary
Given a DOM node, we can go to its immediate neighbors using navigation properties.

There are two main sets of them:

For all nodes: `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `previousSibling`, `nextSibling`.
For element nodes only: `parentElement`, `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, `previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`.
Some types of DOM elements, e.g. tables, provide additional properties and collections to access their content.

>* The DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object.
>
>* All operations on the DOM start with the document object. That’s the main “entry point” to DOM. From it we can access any node.
