## Review Questions

## Summary
Given a DOM node, we can go to its immediate neighbors using navigation properties.

There are two main sets of them:

For all nodes: `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `previousSibling`, `nextSibling`.
For element nodes only: `parentElement`, `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, `previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`.
Some types of DOM elements, e.g. tables, provide additional properties and collections to access their content.

## Intro
>* The DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object. 
>* All operations on the DOM start with the document object. That’s the main “entry point” to DOM. From it we can access any node.

### On top: `documentElement` and `body`
The topmost tree nodes are available directly as `document` properties:
`<html> = document.documentElement`
The topmost document node is `document.documentElement`. That's the DOM node of the `<html>` tag.

`<body> = document.body`
Another widely used DOM node is the `<body>` element – `document.body`.

`<head> = document.head`
The `<head>` tag is available as `document.head.`

⚠️ There’s a catch: document.body can be `null`
A script cannot access an element that doesn’t exist at the moment of running.

In particular, if a script is inside `<head>`, then `document.body` is unavailable, because the browser did not read it yet.

In the DOM, the `null` value means "doesn't exist" or "no such node".

## Children: `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`
[**Child nodes (or children)**]() – elements that are direct children. In other words, they are nested exactly in the given one. For instance, `<head>` and `<body>` are children of `<html>` element.

[**Descendants**]() – all elements that are nested in the given one, including children, their children and so on.

For instance, here `<body>` has children `<div>` and `<ul>` (and few blank text nodes):
```html
<html>
<body>
  <div>Begin</div>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Information</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```
…And *descendants* of `<body>` are not only direct children `<div>`, `<ul>` but also more deeply nested elements, such as `<li>` (a child of `<ul>`) and `<b>` (a child of `<li>`) – the entire subtree.

**The `childNodes` collection lists all child nodes, including text nodes.**
