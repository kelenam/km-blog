## About JavaScript Allong√©
**JavaScript Allong√© is a first and foremost, a book about programming with functions.**

## Why this book?
It was written to describe certain ideas in programming: Working with small, independent entities that compose together to make bigger programs. Thus, the focus on things like writing decorators.

The common thread that runs through all these things(things like classes, mixins, symbols, iterators and generators) is that since they are all simple objects and simple functions, we can use the same set of ‚Äúprogramming with functions‚Äù techniques to build programs by composing small, flexible, and decoupled entities.

## What JavaScript Allong√© is. And isn‚Äôt.
- JavaScript Allong√© is a book about programming with functions
- But while JavaScript Allong√© attempts to be provocative, it is not prescriptive.
- Choices in software development are also often driven by requirements specific to the type of software being developed

Choices in software development must also consider the question of consistency. If a particular codebase is written with lots of helper functions that place the subject first, like this:
```js 
const mapWith = (iterable, fn) =>
  ({
    [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
      for (let element of iterable) {
        yield fn(element);
      }
    }
  });
```

Then it can be jarring to add new helpers written that place the verb first, like this:
```js 
const filterWith = (fn, iterable) =>
  ({
    [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
      for (let element of iterable) {
        if (!!fn(element)) yield element;
      }
    }
  });
```
There are reasons why the second form is more flexible, especially when used in combination with partial application, but does that outweigh the benefit of having an entire codebase do everything consistently the first way or the second way?
