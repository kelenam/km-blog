## approximatelyEqual 
`approximatelyEqual` checks if two numbers are approximately equal to each other.

Use `Math.abs()` to compare the absolute difference of the two values to epsilon. Omit the third parameter, epsilon, to use a default value of 0.001.

```js
const approximatelyEqual = (v1, v2, epsilon = 0.001) => Math.abs(v1 - v2) < epsilon;

approximatelyEqual(Math.PI / 2.0, 1.5708); // true
```
### epsilon
[**Epsilon**](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Epsilon.html) In mathematics, a small positive infinitesimal quantity, usually denoted epsilon or epsilon, whose limit is usually taken as epsilon->0.

Here we are using **epsilon** as the degree of closeness. Is the absolute difference between the first two args, less than than of epsilon (the optional third arg we pass).

Is the difference of these two values, at least `e` in closeness where `e` is an optional third arg with a default of `0.001` in closeness.

```js
const approximatelyEqual = (v1, v2, epsilon = 0.001) => Math.abs(v1 - v2) < epsilon;

approximatelyEqual(1.002, 1.001) //--> false
approximatelyEqual(1.002, 1.001, 0.01) //--> true
```
In the example above, if we don't specify the third argument we will get `false` because...
```js
Math.abs(1.002 - 1.001)
// --> 0.001000000000000112
// this might not be what we are expecting
// but it likely has to do with float arithmetic in JS as a language
// We get this non-precise trailing values that makes
// Math.abs(1.002 - 1.001) greater than 0.001
```
- If you need precise values, and are dealing with a lot of floats or decimals, make sure you have a solid understanding of how JS handles these values, because I myself am still a bit uncertain.

### `Math.abs()`
For a second, let's talk about `Math.abs()`. Refresher, [**absolute value**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value) is simply a numbers distance from 0. This works in either direction, positive or negative. e.g. the absolute value of 1 is 1 the absolute value of -1 is 1.
