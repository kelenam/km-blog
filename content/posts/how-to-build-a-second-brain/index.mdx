Really liked the notes and illustrations Maggie did for: https://illustrated.dev/secondbrain1

Based off the course called Building a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) by Tiago Forte.

## Thoughts
* Using the same labels for things to reduce the friction of *context switching*
* Different areas require different mindsets
* All designations in the created categories of differing levels of actionability
    - A better system of classification should solve teh flow between non-actionable information and actionable tasks. I like to think of it as being areas of knowledge can be translated or made actionable via projects, and doing projects can help build or clarify non-actionable information.

I think to a degree I'm doing most of these things and have over the years developed a similar system, as I imagine most people do. 

Although, for me I would (and this is likely because my interpretation of these semantics/notes is like a game of telephone) switch 'areas' and 'resources'. I have found that having clear and exact resources that represent the area of focused commitment to be more actionable. For example, a link to a specific post to read, a link to a talk, etc.

*Context Switching* is still a pain point of mine.
