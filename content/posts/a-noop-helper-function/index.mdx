## noop
- It's essentially a function that does nothing and returns nothing.
> In computer science, a NOP, no-op, or NOOP (pronounced "no op"; short for no operation) is an assembly language instruction, programming language statement, or computer protocol command that does nothing.  
> Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)

## So why use noop?
- It can serve as a wrapper around potentially expected values without erroring out and blocking other code.
- In our example below we will be using it to verify whether or not something is a function.
- lodash and other js libraries ship with 

## Code Example
```javascript
const noop = () => {};

const noopify = possibleFunction() => {
  return typeof  possibleFunction == "function" ? possibleFunction : noop;
}

const maybeAFunction1 = () => console.log('Hi!');
const maybeAFunction2 = [1,2,3,4,5];
const maybeAFunction3 = null;

// If we tried calling maybeAFunction2 or 3 we would get a syntax error
// maybeAFunction2();
// --> Error

// But by wrapping this function in noopify we are making sure it's
// a useable function otherwise we are getting undefined
// it's essentially like a functional typeChecker
const wrap1 = noopify(maybeAFunction1);
wrap1();

const wrap1 = noopify(maybeAFunction2);
wrap2();

const wrap1 = noopify(maybeAFunction3);
wrap3();

```

## Real-life Example
- Useful, but particularly in React when we have some components 

```jsx:title=src/noopify.js
const noop = () => {};

const noopify = possibleFunction => {
  typeof possibleFunction === "function" ? possibleFunction : noop;
}

export default noopify;
```

```jsx:title=src/index.jsx {10}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import Button from "./Button";
import "./styles.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```
- In the above we just have an app that just shows a button element that when clicked is supposed to run the onclick function passed to it as a prop

```jsx:title=src/Button.jsx {8}
import React from "react";

const Button = ({ onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        alert("Clicked!");
        onClick();
        alert("Second alert!");
      }}
    >
      Click me 
    </button>
  );
};
```
If we went ahead an ran this we would get the first alert but we wouldn't get the second alerty and thats bc we are erroring out (if we check console: `_onClick is not a function`)

In order to fix this problem we can simply 
1. import noopify
2. Then wrap onClick with `noopify`


```jsx:title=src/Button.jsx {3,6,12}
import React from "react";

import noopify from "./noopify";

const Button = ({ onClick }) => {
  const wrappedOnClick = noopify(onClick); 

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        alert("Clicked!");
        wrappedOnClick();
        alert("Second alert!");
      }}
    >
      Click me 
    </button>
  );
};
```

      What is noop? Why might you use a noop function?

<details>
    <summary>
    When might you use a noop helper function?
    </summary>
    You might use one to validate a type, to check to see if something is a function, but more frequently you might use it to avoid erroring-out or blocking other code if an expected value is undefined or null. For example, in React you might be expecting a function to be passed down as a prop to a child component that depends on it, but say the function somehow isn't passed down/isn't written or for whatever reason is passed down as <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>, <code>noop</code> provides a way to handle that possibility without blocking ensuing code.
