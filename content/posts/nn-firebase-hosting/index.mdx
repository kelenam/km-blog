## Intro & Installation
**Firebase** as a whole is what is known as a backend as as service (BaaS), meaning you can leverage all the functions it provides like auth, servers, hosting, functions, and more. You don't have to maintain your own server.

### First things
You need to sign up for a free account.

- Add a project, you can just call it firebase-hosting-ninja.
- Accept terms and create, will take a few minutes
 
- You have access to essentially a whole control panel to your backend project.

We will be focusing on hosting, so click hostting.
- Next we will have to install `firebase-tools`, you can install with npm
- Once downloaded, you can check version number with flag `-V`.

## Initializing & Testing
- Open a simple index.html project file.
