Going to cover local storage in this project.

## HTML 
- We are using a `select` tag with the children being `option` tags, the `value` property of the option tags will be the price. 

### Showcase / seat-legend
- Under this is going to be the "showcase" our seat legend. Its going to show the seats for the movie. It's going to be an unordered list with a class of showcase. 
    - In each `li`, we will have a `div` with a class of `seat`, and a small tag beneath it saying N/A. We will have this three times, for each seat "state"
    - I'm going to change how Traversy set it up and make it that N/A representssetas not available, where white open/able to be selected. 

### Screen/Seat "Visuals"
First we'll wrap everything in a container class, called container.
- then we add a div with a class of screen.

- Add the `screen` class as a div.
- Then create a div with a class of `row` that will have 8 seats in a row.
- Neat Trick, remember if you're making a div and giving it a class the Emmet shortcut is simply saying `.class` and hitting tab.
> - Another trick is that if we want 8 repetitions of the same tag, says 8 divs with a class of `seat` we simply say: `.seat*8` and hit enter and we will get that

We will need 6 rows, so copy this down. 

We can make some of these seats occupied, by adding the occupied classes.

Then we'll have a p tag with a class of text summarizing seat selection. In there we will have a span tag with an id of `count` specifying the number of seats selected.


## CSS 
- Going to import Lato from google fonts
- box sizing reset 
- 

### Using a mixin for the vendor prefix
> So, I was trying to do something like a generic `vendor-prefix` mixin but kept running into the issue of the prefixes needing to end with `:`, I suppose when looked at, at least through VSCode, the pre-processing can't resolve the argument at time of processing, even if its later specified when its used with @include. 
I know there is a better way for writing this, since it wouldn't make any sense to have to do this with every vendor-prefix, so I'll look into this later, for now this will work for case, unless we are using another style that requires prefixing.

```scss 
/* Mixins */
@mixin appearance($value) {
    -webkit-appearance: $value;
    -moz-appearance: $value;
    -ms-appearance: $value;
    appearance: $value;
}

//...

.movie-container {

    select {
        @include appearance(none); 
        padding: 5px 15px 5px 15px;
    }
}

```
### Seat Shapes
- To get the styling on the seats, for that shape we can use the property `border-top-left-radius` and give it a value of 10ps and do that that as well with `border-top-right-radius`.

We can mimic rows in the theater by using a pseudo select, the second row in... `.seat:nth-of-type(2)` and give it a margin right of 18px and do the same on the other side, except `nth-last-of-type(2)`

### Hover Effect on Seats not showcase 
Creating a hover effect for our open seats, with the `:not(className)` pseudo selector, and transforming it up by scaling it by 1.2 
using `:not(.className):hover` to control hover on things not of the specified type, in our case 

We use this same approach, to address turning the hover effect off for the seats in our showcase, where we set the cursor and transform to the `default` and `1` values.

### Showcase styling
Let's add a bg color with rgba, and give it a 0.1 transparency
- add some padding and border-radius and make the text darker
- display flex, justify between.
- remove list style type

### Screen styling
- `box-shadow: 0 3px 10px rgba(255,255,255,0.7);` to give the glow/blur screen effect
- We also are using a transform and rotateX by -45 degrees, this will shrink the screen, to give it the kind of 3d effect of the titled screen, we can give a property to the `.container` class and use `perspective` property and set it to 1000px as well as give the margin-bottom 30px. 


### Making spans colored
Giving our amounts , our span tags a color, `p.text span` setting the color to that blue.


## JavaScript
First thing we do is bring in our DOM elements that we will be using: container, 

> We want to grab all our seats so we use querySelectorAll, `const seats: any = document.querySelectorAll('.seat');` to put them all into a Nodelist, which is like an array.

> We also want to select only the seats in a row (not our showcase), so we can specify further,... `('.row .seat')`, and we can even grab the ones NOT occupied like we did with the css... `const seats: any = document.querySelectorAll('.row .seat:not(.occupied)');`

> Since we want to be doing an operation on our ticket prices/values, we need to turn the value in our span into a number as its currently a string. We can do so with type coercion:  `const ticketPrice = +movieSelected.value;` by adding a `+`. 
Or more explicitly wrap it in a `parseInt()`

### Adding Events
> So there are a few ways we could make our seleted seats have the seleted class, since seats is a nodelist we could foreach and loop through it, but a better way a more performant way is adding the event listener to the container and check that its a seat being clicked...

we can check if the classlist contains seat (so that its a seat that was clicked) and that it was not a seat that is occupied, also checking with contains and an ! inversion prefix.

> - We use `classList.toggle` to toggle on and off a class. 
```js 
function updateSelectedCount() {
    const selectedSeats = document.querySelectorAll('.row .seat.selected');
    const selectedSeatsCount = selectedSeats.length;

    count.innerText = selectedSeatsCount;
    total.innerText = selectedSeatsCount * ticketPrice;
}

container.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (e.target.classList.contains('seat') $$ !e.target.classList.contains('occupied')) {

        e.target.classList.toggle('selected')
        updateSelectedCount();
    }
})
```
### Movie select listener
> So instead of a click event since this is a dropdown, we listen for a change event.... `movieSelected.addEventListener('change' e => {})`

## Key Insights
- Using `nth-of-type()` and `last-of-type()`
- Also using `border-top-radius-right` and left for shaping the individual corners.
- using `:not(.className):hover` to control hover on things not of the specified type, in our case  
- using `perspective` property combined with rotateX to give a 3d-effect for the screen.
