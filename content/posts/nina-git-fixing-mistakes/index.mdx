A few tools that we use to fix mistakes are:
- `checkout`
- `reset`
- `revert`
- `clean`

Fundamentally in order to understand how to fix mistakes, means having a very clear idea of how those three areas of where code lives work: The Working Area, The Staging Area, and The Repository, and how we can move data between them. The first way people learn to fix mistakes is usually with...

## Git Checkout
### Git Checkout

- Restore working tree files _or_ switch branches
- The action that is taken depends on the parameters
- `checkout` can move the head pointer and update the staging area and the working directory.
- If you're checking out a file, it can perform the same actions without moving the pointer.
- A key thing to remember here is how earlier in the course, we said the staging are isn't empty? It's a copy ofhe current commit, it has all the files that are in our current commit and thier SHA, this is an important concept to remember when using `git checkout` ...

### What Happens When you git checkout a branch?
1. Change HEAD to point to the new branch
2. Copy the commit snapshot to the staging area (or index)
3. Update the working area with the branch contents

- Remember when we tried to checkout a branch and git warned us that our files will be overwriten? 
- Changes in the staging area are also capped unless they conflict with any changes in the branch you're abotu to checkout. 
- Checking out a branch is generally a pretty safe operation; git is going to warn you if you're going to lose data.

### What Happens When you git checkout --file?
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5563119/63697880-9518c980-c7d2-11e9-941d-dd2eb2d821e0.png)
Replace the working area copy with the version from the current staging area.
- git recommends this command to be run when you want to remove a file: replace the files in your working area with clean files from the staging area
- **This operation overwrites files in the working directory without a warning and no way of recovering them!**
- It's a destructive operation with no warning. 

### Git checkout: Overwrite Files with Staing Area Copy
**This operation overwrites files in the working directory without warning!**
![](https://placehold.it/400x40/ff6600/000?text=WARNING!)  
- Overwrite the working area file with the staging area version from the last commit.  
    - `git checkout -- < file-path >`  
        - A lot of people get confused about the `--` the two dashes and what they mean. `--` signifies the end of a command operation and the start of positional parameters. So if we had a branch and a file of the same name, `git checkout` can possibly be ambiguous. So with the `--` we're specifying that the next argument is a file in this case and not a branch.

### What Happens When you git checkout < commit > --file?
![](https://placehold.it/400x40/ff6600/000?text=WARNING!)  
**This operation overwrites files in the working directory and the staging area without warning!**
1. Update the staging area to match the commit
2. Update the working area to match the staging area.

- When you're running git checkout and you have unsaved changes, it's time to stop, pause, stash, commit them, do whatever you need to do to get your code in a safe place because that command is very destructive.

### Git checkout: From a specific commit
![](https://placehold.it/400x40/ff6600/000?text=WARNING!)  
**This operation overwrites files in the working directory and the staging area without warning!**
- checkout a file from a specific commit
    - _copies to both working area & staging area_
    - `git checkout < commit >  -- < file path >`

- Restore a delete file
    - `git checkout < deleting_commit >^ -- < file_path >`

## Git Clean & Reset
### Git Clean
- Git clean will clear your working area by **deleting** untracked files.
- WARNING: This operation cannot be undone 

- Use the `--dry-run` flag to see what would be deleted
    - the `-f` flag to do the deletion
    - The `-d` flag will clean directories

### Git Reset
This is a big one, people tend to Google, how do I undo the last commit, and copy and paste the answer from stack overflow; but really understanding `git reset` will really supercharge your workflow.
- Reset is another command that performs different actions depending on the argument.
    - with a path
    - without a path
        - By default, git performs a `git reset -mixed`
    - For commits:
        - Moves the HEAD pointer, optionally modifies files
- A big difference between `git reset` and `git checkout`, `git checkout` will move the HEAD but the branch stays where it was. `git reset` moves the HEAD and it'll move the branch reference, meaning your branch is now modified.
- For file paths;
    - Does not move the HEAD pointer, modifes files

:star: There are three options for reset: soft, mixed (default), and hard.
- soft tends not to be used very frequently.
- again, mixed is the default, and hard is the proceed with caution one as it will blow away working area

I would actually, just go to this video on fem: Git Clean & Reset at the 4:49 timestamp to see the animation on the slides. It's helpful.

### Git reset < commit > Cheat Sheet
(1) Move HEAD and current branch  
(2) Reset the staging area  
(3) Reset the working area  

`git reset --soft` = (1)  
`git reset --mixed` = (1) & (2) (default)  
`git reset --hard` = (1) & (2) & (3)  

### Danger: Git reset can change history!
A reset commit that has no references and work continued from a parent with a new commit, means that "dangling" commit is erased from history.
Warning: Never push changed history to a shared or public repository!

### Git reset -- < file >
`git reset < file >` doesn't move the HEAD pointer, but it does the same thing as a mixed reset. Copies a file from the commit to the staging area.

### Git reset < commit > -- < file >
If we do it from a commit, same thing, I can say: `git reset < commit > -- < file >` put that file in my staging area.  

### Git reset < commit > -- < file > Cheat Sheet
~~(1) Moved HEAD and current branch~~  
(2) Reset the staging area  
~~(3) Reset the working area~~  

It only does step (2).  
This operation does not work with flags!

### Undo a git reset with ORIG_HEAD
- In case of an accidental `git reset -`  
- Git keeps the previous value of HEAD in a variable called `ORIG_HEAD`  
- To go back to the way things were:  
    -`git reset ORIG_HEAD`

## Git Revert
### Git Revert - The "Safe" Reset
- The safe reset.
- `git revert` creates a new commit that introduces the opposite changes from the specified commit.
- The original commit stays in the repository

-**Tip:**  
    - Use revert if you're undoing a commit that has already been shared.
    - Revert **does not** change history.

## Fixing Git Mistakes Solution

### Summary: Common ways of undoing changes
- `checkout`
- `reset`
- `revert`  
Always revert for a shared repository, don't change history.

`git checkout -- < filename >`  
Is quite useful to just checkout a single file, and just revert to that file as it exists outside of the working area. 

>fatal: ambiguous argument 'hello.template': unknown revision or path not in the working tree. Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this...
This error message is what happens when you forget to specify the start of named arguments, you're missing the `--`

You can you `-n 2` params with `git log`, for something like:  
`git log -n 2 --oneline`  
This will let you look at logged the last t
