As we already know, a function in JavaScript is a value.

Every value in JavaScript has a type. What type is a function?

In JavaScript, functions are objects.

A good way to imagine functions is as callable “action objects”. We can not only call them, but also treat them as objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.




## Thoughts
Not quite related but I was working through the "Advanced Working with Functions" section in JS.Info, and was working on one of the closure tasts and came to observe something that I thought I knew but apparently didn't. 


"Post-increment `i++` increments the value of `i` and evaluates to the original non-incremented value."[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/484462/difference-between-pre-increment-and-post-increment-in-a-loop)


```js 
function inc(n) { return n++ } 

function inc(n) { return n += 1 } 
```
