## Naming and the Environment
-[^ **A critical aspect of a programming language is...**]A critical aspect of a programming language is *the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects*, and our first such means are **constants**. We say that the name identifies a constant whose value is the object.

In JavaScript, we name constants using [**constant declarations**]().  
`const size = 2;`  

causes the interpreter to associate the value` 2` with the name `size`.  
- The purpose of the constant declaration is to create this association, and not to compute a particular value as for expression statements
- The JavaScript specification demands that the special value `undefined` shall be the result of evaluating such constant declarations
- Once the association has been made, we can refer to the value `2` by the name we gave it, `size`.
- must declare `size` before we use it, obviously.

Constant declaration is our language's simplest means of abstraction. Complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity.
 
>- [^ **What is an environment responsible for?**]
It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with names and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain *some sort of memory* that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the [**environment**]() (more precisely the [**global environment**](), since we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different environments).
