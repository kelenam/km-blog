This section will cover:
- What is **Node.js**?
- Different formats/standards for JS modules
- Managing modules with `npm` and `yarn`
- Transpiling code with **Babel**
- Watching for changes with `nodemon`
- Linting our code with **ESLint**

### What is Node.js?
- JS on the server.
- Traditionally, SJ is interpreted by a JS engine  that converts JS into optimized machine-executable code. The engine interprets the JS code at the time it is run.
- This is unlike **compiled languages** which must be first compiled into a **intermediate language (IL)** where this IL is then executed by the **common language runtime (CLR)**.

> Technically, it is inaccurate to classify a lang as interpreted/compiled. How a lang is processed depends on the implementation. Someone can build a compiler that converts JS into machine code and run it; in that instance, JS would be a compiled lang.  
> However, since JS is always interpreted by a JS engine, you will hear JS be referred to as as interpreted lanugage.
