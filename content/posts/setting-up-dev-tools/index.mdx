This section will cover:
- What is **Node.js**?
- Different formats/standards for JS modules
- Managing modules with `npm` and `yarn`
- Transpiling code with **Babel**
- Watching for changes with `nodemon`
- Linting our code with **ESLint**

### What is Node.js?
- JS on the server.
- Traditionally, SJ is interpreted by a JS engine  that converts JS into optimized machine-executable code. The engine interprets the JS code at the time it is run.
- This is unlike **compiled languages** which must be first compiled into a **intermediate language (IL)** where this IL is then executed by the **common language runtime (CLR)**.

> Technically, it is inaccurate to classify a lang as interpreted/compiled. How a lang is processed depends on the implementation. Someone can build a compiler that converts JS into machine code and run it; in that instance, JS would be a compiled lang.  
> However, since JS is always interpreted by a JS engine, you will hear JS be referred to as as interpreted lanugage.

Different browsers use different JS engines. Chrome uses V8, Firefox uses Spidermonkey, WebKit for Safari.

Node.js uses V8 as its JavaScript engine and adds C++ bindings that allow it to access operating system resources, such as files and networking. (Aside: checkout Will Setence's course notes here.)

### Terminology
- Other langs have it where their runtimes do actually execute the code, JS is a bit different, despite being considered an "interpreted language".
- The JS engine !== the JS runtime

- The JS engine is the software that translate the high-level JS code into machine executeable code, and then executes it.
- The JS engine then exeposes all the objects obtained from parsing the code to the JS runtime environment, which can then use it.

That means JS in the browser has a different runtime environment than Node. This is evident by `window` object in browsers and `global` objects in node. Conversely, the browser runtime lacks the `require` global, and cannot act on system resources such as file systems (thankfully, althought this may change as the web becomes more powerful, still would be security-scary to have browsers accessing the fs).

### Modules
Clean code should be structured in a modular way. It's important because without it...
- Logic from one business domain can easily be interwoven with that of another
- when debugging, it's hard to identify where the bug is
- There'll likely be duplicate code

Writing modular code means:
- Modules are logical separations of domains. This ensures a clear **separation of concerns**.
- Each modules should have a very specific purpose--that is, it should be granular. This ensures there is as much **code reusability** as possible.
- Each modules provides an API for other modules to interact with. It should also hide internal properties and methods to ensure that the API is as minimal as is practical.

#### The dawn of modules
JS was initially design to add small bits of interactivity to web pages, not for building full-fledged web apps. 
- Script tags had to be loaded in a specific order based on dependencies
    - this is fine when dependency tree is small, however SPAs and node.js increased complexity of web-apps: posed issues of namespace clashing, override conflicts, etc.
- Because of increasing complexity **package managers** created to standardize formats, and make it easier to share modules.

At time of writing:   
- three major package managers: **NPM**, **Bower**, **Yarn**. 
- four major standards in defining modules: **CommonJS**, **AMD**, **UMD**, and **ES6 modules**.
    - each format has corresponding tools, e.g.: **RequireJS**, **Browserify**, **Webpack**, **Rollup**, and **SystemJS**.

#### The birth of Node.js modules
Using modules on the client was infeasible bc of an application could have hundreds of dependencies making for a really long **time-to-first-render (TTFR)**. 

JS modules as we know them, began on servers with Node.js modules.

In Node.js, a single file correponds to a single module.

#### Adoption of the CommonJS standard
In Node.js modules are written in the CommonJS format, which provides two global objects (allowing for modules to remain encapsulated):
1. `require`: a function that llows the current module to import and use variables defined in other modules
2. `exports`: is an object that allows a module to make certain variables publicly available to other modules that `require` it.

For example:
```js:title=greeter.js
const helloWorld = function (name) {
    process.stdout.write('hello ${name}! \n')
};
const internal = function (name) {
    process.stdout.write('This is a private function')
};
exports.sayHello = helloWorld;
```
- These two functions only useable within the file (module)
- When we assign the `helloWorld` function to the `sayHello` property of `exports`, it makes the `helloWorld` function accessible to other modules that `require` the `greeeter` module.

To demo this...
```js:title=main.js
const greeter = require('./greeter.js');
greeter.sayHello("Daniel");
//-->  hello Daniel!
```
- To `require` a module, you can either specifiy its name or its file path.

### Fufilling the encapsulation requirement
- You can export multiple constructs from a single module by adding them as properties to the `exports` object.
- Constructs that are not exported are not available outside the module because Node.js wraps its modules inside a **module wrapper** which is simply a function that contians the module code:
```js
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __firname) {
    // Module Code
})
```

### Standarizing module formats
- **AMD** (Asynchronous Module Definition) is an early fork of the CommonJS format. It supports **Asynchronous module loading**.
- **UMD** (Universal Definition Module) tried to standarize AMD and CommonJS and become just another standard.

Eventually, Ecma International took it upon themselves to standardize the modules and do so in the ECMAScript2015 (ES6) version of JS.
- This format uses two keywords: `import` and `export`. The same `greeter` example would look liek this with ES6 modules.

The same example from before using ES6 Modules looks like:
```js
// greeter.js
const helloWorld = function(name) {
    process.stdout.write(`hello ${name}!\n`);
};
const privateHelloWorld = function(name) {
    process.stdout.write(`This is a private function`);
};
export default helloWorld;

// main.js
import greeter from "./greweter.js";
greeter.sayHello("Daniel");
```
- still two files, only syntax slight different with `export` and `import`.
- ES6 modules are **static**, meaning they cannot be changed at runtime: the reason is modules must be first analyzed and dependency graph to be created beforehand.
- Node.js and popular browsers are quickly adding support for ES6 feature but currently none of them fully support modules (Q4 2019)
- Luckily, there are tools that can convert ECMAScript2015 modules into the universally supported CommonJS format: **Babel** and **Traceur**.

### Installing Node
There are many ways to dl node. 
- Easiest way is to use **Node Version Manager (nvm)**, has added benefit of switching between different versions of Node.

### Using nvm to install Node
You can install nvm using the shell script, using curl from the repo.
```
$ curl -o- https://{nvmrepo}/install.sh | bash
$ source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

### Summary Insights
- `exports` is simple an object. We are adding properties on that object in order to export that bundled function/functionality.
- **Module wrappers** leverage JavaScript's function scoping in order to keep the module contents encapsulated. Seems obvious once you think about it, but kind of cool tidbit to reflect on.
- This section clarified for me how/why/who ES6 Modules came from. I can see the syntax changes between the two.
