## Creating a Web Server
We are still working with SQLite, but also with HTTP.

Our web server is going to have an API endpoint that is going to server up our database records to a webpage.

- First thing that we need to do is pull in the HTTP module.
- We are also going to be using a package called `node-static-alias` which is a wrapper around a more commonly known package called node static. It handles all to the MIME type handling and content link calculation, all the stuff we don't really want to do and node-static is great for this, `node-static-alias` is a wrapper around it which gives us a bit more declarative alias URL routing.

Line 45 is how we make a new server.

So we need to listen on that port, we do so by calling `.listen` on our server and provide a port: `httpserv.listen(HTTP_PORT)` 

When we are writing our `handleRequest` function, it takes as arguments, a `req` and a `res` these are both streams, the are HTTP streams, but work like we've previously seen.

- We can make this a function an `async` one to better handle asynchronous operations to handle our incoming requests.
- We can all `res.end` to make sure the stream is "flushed" or finished, but since we are only passing in one string with write, our Hello World, we can actually just pass it directly to end like so.... `res.end("Hello World")`  

### A Note on Node Web Frameworks
All things like Express,Hapi, Sails, etc, all these router frameworks really they boil down to a series of if statements they have very fancy APIs and lots of complexity but what they really boil down to is a set of if statements, like we could technically just do something like this ...

```js
async function handleRequest(req, res) {
    if (req.url === "/hello") {
        res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
        res.end("Hello World")
    } else {
        res.writeHead(404);
        res.end();
    }
}
```
It really doesn't get any more complicated of a series of matching decisions that you can model with a series of if statements. You might match on whether or not the request method was a GET / POST or if there are cookies/the right headers.

## Routing & Serving Static Files
You might wonder, well to serve up some files, could we, like use file streams? We learned about them already. So what if we were to open up a read stream to an HTML file and then pipe that read stream to our writeable stream? Well its true that the content would make its way to the web browswer, but we would by missing, chunking/encoding, gzip, headers, etc, content length, all the important stuff a static file server would handle for us.

This is why we are going to use `node-static-alias`
 
- We give it a `WEB_PATH` which is essentially going to be the document root, which protects against someone looking up some other relative path elsewhere on our filesystem. We can set up aliases to have regular expressions 

- `force: true` tells it that it has to find a match to the regex, or it will throw a 404 
```js {7,10,42-61,73,80}
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict";

var util = require("util");
var path = require("path");
var http = require("http");

var sqlite3 = require("sqlite3");
var staticAlias = require("node-static-alias");


// ************************************

const DB_PATH = path.join(__dirname,"my.db");
const WEB_PATH = path.join(__dirname,"web");
const HTTP_PORT = 8039;

var delay = util.promisify(setTimeout);

// define some SQLite3 database helpers
//   (comment out if sqlite3 not working for you)
var myDB = new sqlite3.Database(DB_PATH);
var SQL3 = {
	run(...args) {
		return new Promise(function c(resolve,reject){
			myDB.run(...args,function onResult(err){
				if (err) reject(err);
				else resolve(this);
			});
		});
	},
	get: util.promisify(myDB.get.bind(myDB)),
	all: util.promisify(myDB.all.bind(myDB)),
	exec: util.promisify(myDB.exec.bind(myDB)),
};

var fileServer = new staticAlias.Server(WEB_PATH,{
	cache: 100,
	serverInfo: "Node Workshop: ex5",
	alias: [
        {
            match: /^\/(?:index\/?)?(?:[?#].*$)?$/,
            serve: "index.html",
            force: true,
		},
		{
			match: /^\/js\/.+$/,
			serve: "<% absPath %>",
			force: true,
		},
		{
			match: /^\/(?:[\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/,
			serve: function onMatch(params) {
				return `${params.basename}.html`;
			},
		},
		{
			match: /[^]/,
			serve: "404.html",
		},
	],
});

var httpserv = http.createServer(handleRequest);

main();


// ************************************

function main() {
    httpserv.listen(HTTP_PORT);  
    console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${HTTP_PORT}...`);
}

function handleRequest(req, res) {
//   res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
//   res.end("Hello World");
    fileServer.serve(req,res)
}
// *************************
// NOTE: if sqlite3 is not working for you,
//   comment this version out
// *************************
async function getAllRecords() {
	var result = await SQL3.all(
		`
		SELECT
			Something.data AS "something",
			Other.data AS "other"
		FROM
			Something
			JOIN Other ON (Something.otherID = Other.id)
		ORDER BY
			Other.id DESC, Something.data
		`
	);

	return result;
}

// *************************
// NOTE: uncomment and use this version if
//   sqlite3 is not working for you
// *************************
// async function getAllRecords() {
// 	// fake DB results returned
// 	return [
// 		{ something: 53988400, other: "hello" },
// 		{ something: 342383991, other: "hello" },
// 		{ something: 7367746, other: "world" },
// 	];
// }

```

## Serving API Endpoints
Not that we are serving up files, the next question might be, how could I respond to AJAX requests? How can we have an API endpoint for our code?

So back on over to our handle request function we are going to set an `if` statemetn, that if the incoming request looks like an API request we're going to handle it manually, otherwise for every other request we are going to hand it off to the file server.

```js:title=handle-API-endpoint
async function handleRequest(req, res) {
    if (req.url === "/get-records") {
        let records = await getAllRecords();
         
         res.writeHead(200, { 
             "Content-type:" "application/json",
             "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
        });
        res.end(JSON.stringify(records));
    } else {
        filesServer.serve(req,res);
    }
}
```
- So we already have that `getAllRecords` function, 
- So how are we going to send out a JSOn response? Well it's similar to what we did before... with `res.writeHead`
- Because we don't want our JSON to be cached we send down a cache control header that says no-cache.
- Then we res.send by stringifiying that json

So now this means, from our web page side, we can make an AJAX cal and get that data and print it.

## Fetch Exercise
Now if we go over to our Ex5 file in the /web folder
await fetch(url)

You can either do `res.ok` or `res.status === 200` to check for the response headers. `res.ok` works just fine. 

An interesting thing about `fetch` is that it first does a request and then you have to wait for the body of the response, and that allows you to do somet streaming processing on a response body if it were large.

We only care about a JSON response, so we can say `let recoreds = await res.json()` this parses the body and gives us json back. So if records and records.length is greater than 0 then what we want to do is call render records with it.....
```js
async function getRecords() {
	const res = await fetch('/get-records');
	if (res && res.ok) {
		let records = await res.json(); 
		if (records && records.length > 0) {
			renderRecords(records);
		}
	}
}
```
We can go back and make one last change to our server, let's simulate our results coming back slower. let's insert a delay in our response from the database.

## Express JS Routing 
Express is one of the more well known frameworks, and sinc in Ex5 we kind of were doing things manually, we'll not take a look at with Express.

The way Express works, is that you call the express function... the name you give this thing is almost always called  `app`
```js
var app = express();
```
So what is `app` exactly, what is the thing returned to us? Is it an instantiated class, an object? Well let's see how we actually use it.
Well we atually use it by passing it to our http server instance: `var httpserv = http.createServer(app)`, if you remember previously we passed the function `handleRequest` to the function that we defined, so in other words, `app` is an automatically generated handle request function that receives requests and response streams and handles them. And in fact if you were to open up that `app` function, under the hood it would just be a fancy for loop with some if statemetns in it.

We won't define a `handleRequest` function, but we will need to configure Express so that it knows which routes to use, we will use a function for this.
- Don't forget to call defineRoutes() in our main function.
```js
function defineRoutes() {

	app.get("/get-records" (req,res) => {
		var records = await getAllRecords();
		res.writeHead(200, {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
			"Cache-Control": "no-cache"
		});
		res.end(JSON.stringify(records));
	})
}
```
So we need to set up the equivalent to our alias routes, by doing so with Express, this is accomplished with things called **middleware**. [**Middleware**]() is just a fancy way of basically just saying a function that gets called if the incoming request matches some particular criteria, so we are going to setup a couple of different middlewares equivalent to the routes we were handling.

- we use `app.get` to tell Express to handle get requests, and we give it a url. and if it matches it we are going to receive, req and res.

So notice, we are essentially repeating this JSON handler portion, there are some things Express provides to make its own version of this, but you may find out that Express needs its own set of plugins for some very basic things, which is why, for the sake of our learning here we are just going to repeat it.

The point with the code above, is that we aren't using if statements, but instead declaratively state the route by calling `app.get`, and Express just handles the matching for us.

## Serving Static Files with Express
Now we also want to route for our static file handling requests...
```js
function defineRoutes() {
	app.get("/get-records" (req,res) => {
		var records = await getAllRecords();
		res.writeHead(200, {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
			"Cache-Control": "no-cache"
		});
		res.end(JSON.stringify(records));
	});

	
	var fileServer = express.static(WEB_PATH,{
		maxAge: 100,
		setHeaders(res){
			res.setHeader("Server","Node Workshop: ex6");
		}
	});

	app.use(fileServer);

	app.get(/\.html$/,function friendly404(req,res,next){
		req.url = "/404.html";
		fileServer(req,res,next);
	});
}
```
- For this we use `app.use` this is the general form of middleware. 
- `app.get` it's specifically for GET requests. `app.use` is for all incoming requests. For it we can call `express.static`, and we are going to configure it to use our web path as the doc route + some other options which aren't strictly necessary.
- This `setHeaders` function is called whenever we have an outbound request and we need to add custom headers with Express.

## Custom Routing Middleware
KS couldn't find any decent Express plugin for handling url rewrites. So we end up just keep using regex.
```js {11-25}
function defineRoutes() {
	app.get("/get-records", async (req,res) => {
		var records = await getAllRecords();
		res.writeHead(200, {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
			"Cache-Control": "no-cache"
		});
		res.end(JSON.stringify(records));
	});

	app.use(function(req, res, next) {
		if (/^\/(?:index\/?)?(?:[?#].*$)?$/.test(req.url)) {
			req.url = "/index.html";
		}
		else if (/^\/js\/.+$/.test(req.url)) {
			next();
			return;
		}
		else if (/^\/(?:[\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/.test(req.url)) {
			let [,basename] = req.url.match(/^\/([\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/);
			req.url = `${basename}.html`;
		}

		next();
	})

	var fileServer = express.static(WEB_PATH,{
		maxAge: 100,
		setHeaders(res){
			res.setHeader("Server","Node Workshop: ex6");
		}
	});

	app.use(fileServer);

	app.get(/\.html$/,function friendly404(req,res,next){
		req.url = "/404.html";
		fileServer(req,res,next);
	});
}
```
> - What you should pay attention to if you're using your own middleware is that if they're going to be asynchronous then you want to include a third parameter you have to call as the callback (often called `next`), you have to execute `next` to tell Express that it should move on to the next route. If you don't call `next()` it will assume you completely handled the response, but if you want it to flow to the next thing you need to call `next`

So we should point out that what is happening here is that these middleware calls, are adding these functions that you've defined into an internal array, and what Express does anytime a request comes in, is to loop over that array calling a function and seeing whether or not that function fully handles the response or not, if so then its done, if not then it moves on to the next one in the for loop, and the next one and next one.

It's a top down ordering, and the order in which you define these routes matter. If you define a general more catchall route earlier, its going to catch all of them and never get to the specific one, so you end up defining this by specific first back down to general. 

So our strategy is just replacing the req url so that when it gets to express static file server it knows to just go and find the appropriately named file.

### Reason for usign Express
- large community
- tons of documentation
- huge ecosystem
- every job posting for Node, they want you to know Express
