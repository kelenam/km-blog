## Start with a feature, not a layout
- an app is simply a collection of features, so start with one feature.
- think of the interface you are trying to build, and ask questions, like what things/fields you might need?
    - start with that, start with what you need
    - the rest of the stuff comes later, sometimes you won't even need it.

## Detail comes later
- Don't get hung up on low-levels decisions early. You don't need to pick the perfect typeface,shadows, icons, now.
- Don't obsess over tails, in fact, use a sharpie. Broad strokes makes its hard to stay super detailed.
- You want to get a quick layout idea out, not yet worrying about getting it picture perfect.

### Hold the Color
- By using grayscale you are forced to think about and consider appropriately the contrast of your elements, and the readability of those elements.

### Don't over-invest
The whole point of lo-fi is to move fast and keeps things disposable that you can try out.

## Don't design too much

## Choose a personality

## Limit your choices
