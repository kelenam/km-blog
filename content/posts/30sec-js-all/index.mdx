### all

The `all` function Returns `true` if the provided predicate function returns `true` for all elements in a collection, `false` otherwise.

Use `Array.prototype.every()` to test if all elements in the collection return `true` based on fn. Omit the second argument, fn, to use Boolean as a default.

```js
const all = (arr, fn = Boolean) => arr.every(fn);
```

Examples
```js
all([4, 2, 3], x => x > 1); // true
all([1, 2, 3]); // true
```

### Notes
**predicate:** filter criteria (in our case a function that evaluates to a Boolean value)
> In mathematics, a predicate is either a relation or the boolean-valued function that amounts to the characteristic function or the > indicator function of such a relation.
> A function P: Xâ†’ {true, false} is called a predicate on X. When P is a predicate on X, we sometimes say P is a property of X.

### Confusions
##### I'm not too certain what `fn = Boolean` is doing.
- I know it's making Boolean the default function in the absence of the optional predicate.
- `Boolean` is actually just a function, that seems to evaluate the value passed in as an arg to be its corresponding truthy/falsy value.
    - `Boolean("")` would evaluate to `false`, as would an empty array. Any truthy evaluated value will return `true`.
- Okay I get it now.
##### I'm not too sure how `.every()` is working...
**Syntax** : `arr.every(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])`
- Takes a callback as an argument. 
- That callback can take up to 3 parameters: element, index, array.
- The return value of every is `true` if the callback function returns a truthy value for every array element. Otherwise, `false`.
- Okay, that makes sense.

##### Why might I use or write this `all` function over simply using `Array.protoytype.every()`?
- I think from first glance, it can be useful if you're evaluting if something exists or is empty.
    - By adding the default `Boolean` we can check to see whether or not an array/string is empty.
- It can be be a cleaner syntax? Maybe.

##### When might we use `all`?
- So I was thinking why this over using something like `.filter`? and I think it might be useful where you are trying to analyze a set or a group to see if there are any disqualifying features of that set. For example, if there is there are an array of ages or something, and the array represents a group or party. Maybe we are trying to recommend activities and you want to make sure everyone can participate, if one of your possible recommendations is a bar or some night-life activity you'd want to make sure everyone in the party is above 21 or something.
