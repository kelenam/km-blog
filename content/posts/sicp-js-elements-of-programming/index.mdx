A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

 >[^ **What is the difference between: _primitive expressions_, _means of combination_, _means of abstraction_?**] 1. [**primitive expressions**](), which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
 > 1. [**means of combination**](), by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
 > 1. [**means of abstraction**](), by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

 >* [^ **In programming, we essentially deal with two kinds of elements, what are they?**]**In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data.**
 
 Informally, [**data**]() is stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. 
 
 >[^ **Any powerful programming language should be able to describe...**]Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive functions and should have methods for combining and abstracting functions and data.
 
## Key Insights
Thinking of common operations as just functions themselves, is kind of like an, 'oh yeah', that makes sense moment.

## TIL 
Today I learned, the JS spec demands that the `undefined` shall be the result of evaluating such constant declarations. Like I've always known that but never really internalized as to why it might be happening.
