## Review Questions
1. In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements, what are they?

A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

 > 1. [**primitive expressions**](), which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
 > 1. [**means of combination**](), by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
 > 1. [**means of abstraction**](), by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

 >* **In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data.**
 
 Informally, [**data**]() is stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. 
 
 Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive functions and should have methods for combining and abstracting functions and data.

## Expressions
- easiest way to get started with JS is the console in the browser itself.
- JavaScript programs are called [**statements**]().

- One kind of statement is an [**expression statement**](), which consists of an [**expression**](), followed by a semicolon. A simple kind of expression is a number. (More precisely, the epxression consists of  the numerals that represent the number in base 10)

- Expressions representing numbers may be combined with operators (such as + or *) to form a compound expression that respresents the application of a corresponding primitive function to those numbers.
`137 + 429`  
`100 - 9`  
`10 / 5`  
- You can think of the `+`, `-`, `/` as an addition function.

Expressions such as these which contain other expressions as components, are called [**combinations**]().  
Combinations that are formed by an *operator* symbol in the middle, and *operand* expressions to the left and right of it, are called [**operator combinations**](). 

>* **The value of an operator combination is obtained by applying the function specified by the operator to the *arguments* that are the values of the operands.**

The convention of placing the operator between the operands is known as [**infix notation**](). It follows the mathematical notation that you already know.

As in mathematics, operator combinations can be nested, that is, they can take arguments that themselves are operator combinations:
`(3 * 5) + (10 - 6);`

- Parentheses are used to group operator combinations to avoid ambiguities.
- JS follows convention: mult/div stronger than add/sub.

We say that `*` and `/` have [**higher precedence**]() than `+` and `-`. Sequences of additions and subtractions are read from left to right, as are sequences of multiplications and divisions.  
`3 / 5 * 2 - 4 + 3;`
stands for
`(((3 / 5) * 2) - 4) + 3;`
We say that the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` are left-associative.

The interpreter always operates in the same basic cycle: It reads a statement from the browser, evaluates the statement, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a [**read-eval-print loop**](). Observe in particular that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the interpreter to print the value of the statement.

## Naming and the Environment
A critical aspect of a programming language is *the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects*, and our first such means are **constants**. We say that the name identifies a constant whose value is the object.

In JavaScript, we name constants using [**constant declarations**](). Typing
`const size = 2;`  
causes the interpreter to associate the value` 2` with the name `size`.  
- The purpose of the constant declaration is to create this association, and not to compute a particular value as for expression statements
- The JavaScript specification demands that the special value undefined shall be the result of evaluating such constant declarations
- Once the association has been made, we can refer to the value `2` by the name we gave it, `size`.
- must declare `size` before we use it, obviously.

Constant declaration is our language's simplest means of abstraction. Complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity.

It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with names and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain *some sort of memory* that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the [**environment**]() (more precisely the [**global environment**](), since we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different environments).

## Evaluating Operator Combinations
## Functions

## Key Insights
Thinking of common operations as just functions themselves, is kind of like an, 'oh yeah', that makes sense moment.

## TIL 
Today I learned, the JS spec demands that the `undefined` shall be the result of evaluating such constant declarations. Like I've always known that but never really internalized as to why it might be happening.
