## What is TailwindCSS?
[**tailwind**] is a utility-first, utility-based low level css framework.

Fundamental difference between materialize/bootstrap in that it isn't comprised of premade components (navs, cards, components, etc), the downside is that all the sides look the same.
- Tailwind instead gives you a whole bunch of utility classes to build our own components.
- Tailwind based on utilities as opposed to components and its much lower level.

### Installing
- There is a CDN (with limitations), we are going to use:
`npm install tailwindcss`
or
`yarn add tailwindcss`

### Adding Tailwind to your css
Use the `@tailwind `directive to inject Tailwind's base, components, and utilities styles into your CSS:
```css
@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```
We are going to have to run a build command to build out the css we want to include in our html, 
we can make a new folder, `src` that holds `styles.css` where we add the above, then we will create a new folder called `dist` or whatever, that will be hold our `index.html` and our ouput stylesheet, we can just call the same `styles.css`

- Over in `package.json` add a script: 
```json
"scipts": {
    "build:css": "tailwind build src/styles.csss -o dist/style.css"
}
```
In this way we are using the `-o` flag to mark the output name of the file which is going to be the `style.css` file in our `/dist` dir.

Now we can go, in terminal and run the command `npm run build:css`

Basically, that the `@tailwind` line are doing are importing base functionality as our styles, its kind of like a normalize css. A ton of utilities 

### Background colors
The first thing we are going to do is look at a bunch of the default utility colors we can see in the docs.
let's make the body blue by giving it the class.
```html
<body class="bg-blue-700">
    <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
        Find Friends
    </button>
```
Then lets add a 500 shade blue button, make the inner text white (`.text-white`), if we want to make it bold we use `.font-bold`.
- as far as padding goes: we use `py-2` for top and bottom padding of 2 units, and `px-4` for padding on the left and right of 4 units., and we want this all to be rounded so we add the rounded class. And inside this button we will have the text, `find friends`.

What's really cool is that we haven't even touched any css, we can even handle hover effects with...
`hover:bg-blue-400`

There is a container class so lets move the button into the container div
```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-2">
...
</div>
```
If we look at the css for the container its just a max-width. No margin auto, no padding. It's all pretty unopinionated. We an change breakpoints of the max-width in the config file, we will create shortly...

If we did want this to be margin auto and give it some padding, we could just say `mx-` (which is margin on the x-axis), `mx-auto` and for the padding we could do `px-2`, now it's in got some room in our container.

### Create Your Tailwind config file
We just run : `npx tailwind init`

In this config file we can change the font family, the color, margins, breakpoints, etc. It's very customizeable.

Let's go into that newly created `tailwind.config.js` file and set some properties on our `container`
```js {4-7}
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '2rem'
    }
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```
Now, we can get rid of the `mx-auto` and the `px-2` in our `container` because this is the default we just set in the config file. To see this applied, we do have to rerun the build, using `yarn build:css`

### Extending Utility classes with CSS
If you wanted traditional styles like you wanted to add classic, button styles to a a `.btn` class you could, right beneat your `@tailwind imports in your src/style.css file.

#### `@apply` directive
There is even an `@apply` directive that allows us to use those same utilites right in our css..
```css
.btn {
    @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
```
More work to do it this way, but just showing you that, you can.

### Spacing / Padding
- `.p-2` is going to be padding all around. 2 is in rem. 
- `.py` is going to be y axis padding

Same with margin except with `m` and width is just `w` goes up to 64, also has `-min` `-max` and `-auto`.

### Flex
Adding a class of flex, will turn the element into display flex.
- align-items, stretch, etc.

### Creating an alert
```html
    <!-- ALERT COMPONENT -->
    <div class="bg-red-100 border border-red-400 text-red-700 px-4 py-3 rounded relative my-5" role="alert">
        <strong class="font-bold">Alert! </strong>
        <span class="block sm:inline"></span>
    </div>
```
- this line: `<span class="block sm:inline"></span>`, means that by default this span is going to be `block` by on screens small aand up `sm:inline` are going to be inline instead of block.

### Creating a Card Column
Outside of our container div, we can start adding our card columns.
```html

```
