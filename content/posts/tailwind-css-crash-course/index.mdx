## What is TailwindCSS?
[**tailwind**] is a utility-first, utility-based low level css framework.

Fundamental difference between materialize/bootstrap in that it isn't comprised of premade components (navs, cards, components, etc), the downside is that all the sides look the same.
- Tailwind instead gives you a whole bunch of utility classes to build our own components.
- Tailwind based on utilities as opposed to components and its much lower level.

### Installing
- There is a CDN (with limitations), we are going to use:
`npm install tailwindcss`
or
`yarn add tailwindcss`

### Adding Tailwind to your css
Use the `@tailwind `directive to inject Tailwind's base, components, and utilities styles into your CSS:
```css
@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```
We are going to have to run a build command to build out the css we want to include in our html, 
we can make a new folder, `src` that holds `styles.css` where we add the above, then we will create a new folder called `dist` or whatever, that will be hold our `index.html` and our ouput stylesheet, we can just call the same `styles.css`

- Over in `package.json` add a script: 
```json
"scripts": {
    "build:css": "tailwind build src/style.css -o dist/style.css"
}
```
In this way we are using the `-o` flag to mark the output name of the file which is going to be the `style.css` file in our `/dist` dir.

Now we can go, in terminal and run the command `npm run build:css`

Basically, that the `@tailwind` line are doing are importing base functionality as our styles, its kind of like a normalize css. A ton of utilities 

### Background colors
The first thing we are going to do is look at a bunch of the default utility colors we can see in the docs.
let's make the body blue by giving it the class.
```html
<body class="bg-blue-700">
    <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
        Find Friends
    </button>
```
Then lets add a 500 shade blue button, make the inner text white (`.text-white`), if we want to make it bold we use `.font-bold`.
- as far as padding goes: we use `py-2` for top and bottom padding of 2 units, and `px-4` for padding on the left and right of 4 units., and we want this all to be rounded so we add the rounded class. And inside this button we will have the text, `find friends`.

What's really cool is that we haven't even touched any css, we can even handle hover effects with...
`hover:bg-blue-400`

There is a container class so lets move the button into the container div
```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-2">
...
</div>
```
If we look at the css for the container its just a max-width. No margin auto, no padding. It's all pretty unopinionated. We an change breakpoints of the max-width in the config file, we will create shortly...

If we did want this to be margin auto and give it some padding, we could just say `mx-` (which is margin on the x-axis), `mx-auto` and for the padding we could do `px-2`, now it's in got some room in our container.

### Create Your Tailwind config file
We just run : `npx tailwind init`

In this config file we can change the font family, the color, margins, breakpoints, etc. It's very customizeable.

Let's go into that newly created `tailwind.config.js` file and set some properties on our `container`
```js {4-7}
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '2rem'
    }
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```
Now, we can get rid of the `mx-auto` and the `px-2` in our `container` because this is the default we just set in the config file. To see this applied, we do have to rerun the build, using `yarn build:css`

### Extending Utility classes with CSS
If you wanted traditional styles like you wanted to add classic, button styles to a a `.btn` class you could, right beneat your `@tailwind imports in your src/style.css file.

#### `@apply` directive
There is even an `@apply` directive that allows us to use those same utilites right in our css..
```css
.btn {
    @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
```
More work to do it this way, but just showing you that, you can.

### Spacing / Padding
- `.p-2` is going to be padding all around. 2 is in rem. 
- `.py` is going to be y axis padding

Same with margin except with `m` and width is just `w` goes up to 64, also has `-min` `-max` and `-auto`.

### Flex
Adding a class of flex, will turn the element into display flex.
- align-items, stretch, etc.

### Creating an alert
```html
    <!-- ALERT COMPONENT -->
    <div class="bg-red-100 border border-red-400 text-red-700 px-4 py-3 rounded relative my-5" role="alert">
        <strong class="font-bold">Alert! </strong>
        <span class="block sm:inline"></span>
    </div>
```
- this line: `<span class="block sm:inline"></span>`, means that by default this span is going to be `block` by on screens small and up `sm:inline` are going to be inline instead of block.

### Creating a Card Component
Outside of our container div, since we are going to be using the `max-width` utility anyways, we can start adding our card columns.
```html
   <div class="max-w-sm mx-auto flex p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0">
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="" class="h-12 w-12">
        </div>
    </div>
```
- `max-w-sm`, means we are setting the max width of this size to small (not that big a few ems)
- `mx-auto` make the l/r margin automatic
- `flex` - going to be a flew
- `p-6`- 6rem of padding all around   
- `bg-white` - wht bg
- `rounded`- rounded, we can even add `-lg` to 
- `shadow-xl` - will give this an extra large shadow

We don't want any of the internal content to shrink so we use a `flex-shrink-0` class here, then we add our image.
Then we give it some height and width, of 12, which is actually rem, (goes up to h-64, 16rem)
- Because we used `flex` for the parent, these children shouuld be side by side
- Going to give this a margin of 6,
- `pt-1` padding top of 1
    - Inside this div, we are going to create an h4, by default the text doesn't have any kind of font size, its just a regular font size, we will give it text-xl and make it text-gray-900, with a title
    - `text-base.text-gray-600` You have a new message.

### Card Column 

```html
<div class ="container mt-5"
    <!-- Flex on med screens and up  -->
    <div class="md:flex">
        <div class="flex-1 text-gray-700 text-center bg-gray-400 px-5 py-5 m-2 rounded">
            <div class="lg:flex lg:items-center">
                <div class="lg:flex-shrink-0">
                    <img class="rounded-lg lg:w-64" />
                    <div class="mt-4 lg:mt-0 lg:ml-6">
                        <div class="uppercase tracking-wide text-sm-text-indigo-600 font-bold">
                        <!-- ... --->
```
- We are creating another container, with a top of margin of 5
- `md:flex` what this is going to do is make it responsive: on medium screens and up its going to be flexbox, the cards will go horizontal, but on smaller screens, it will stay veritcal.
- two divs with flex-1 meaning they will be the same width 
- then here, on line 5 we are going to have another flex for large screens, basically an image with some text next to it, on large screens we want text and image to be side by side, less than that and they will be on top of each other.
- `lg:center` is also going to center it, and then essentially anything with an lg ensuiing will be related to adapting/flexing for the lg screen sizes.
- `lg:w-64` the image on large screens is going to be 16rem or w64, anything below that it will just be 100% because that is the default.

### Navbar Component
There is no navbar component, but its made up of a bunch of utilities
```html
 <!-- NAVBAR COMPONENT -->
    <nav class="flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-gray-800 p-6">
      <div class="flex items-center flex-shrink-0 text-white mr-6">
        <span class="font-bold text-xl">Biznet</span>
      </div>

      <div class="w-full block flex-grow sm:flex sm:items-center sm:w-auto">
        <div class="text-sm sm:flex-grow">
          <a
            href="#"
            class="block mt-4 sm:inline-block sm:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white mr-4"
          >
            Your Business
          </a>
          <a
            href="#"
            class="block mt-4 sm:inline-block sm:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white mr-4"
          >
            Networking
          </a>
          <a
            href="#"
            class="block mt-4 sm:inline-block sm:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white"
          >
            Blog
          </a>
        </div>
        <div>
          <a
            href="#"
            class="inline-block text-sm px-4 py-2 leading-none border rounded text-white border-white hover:border-transparent hover:text-blue-500 hover:bg-white mt-4 md:mt-0"
            >Login</a
          >
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
```
- we have our `nav` tag, we are centering all our items with `items-center`, we are using `justify-between` that means all the remaining space goes in between. we are using.
- `w-full` is basically width 100%, small screens will be flex on small screens.

## Key Insights
- Emmet: just leading with your class names, and chaining them with `.` works if you want to create a div with those corresponding classes: e.g. `.max-w-sm.mx-auto`
- Everything just kind of works out of the box and is super intuitive. I think this is what I had expected Bootstrap to be back in the day. I'm not too big a fan of how cluttered the html ends up looking. I'm wondering how this might look with react/vue, using styled components to keep the utilities at the top of the file might be interesting, I'll look into it more.
