## Continuous Integration
### Continuous Integration
- Merging smaller commits frequently, instead of waiting until a project is "done" and doing one big merge.
- This means that features can be released quicker!
- CI only works well when there are tests that ensure that new commits didn't "break the build"
- It's even possible to perform a deployment at the end of a CI build!
```
Commit ---> Test ---> Merge ---> (optional) --> Deploy
```
### Travis CI - Integrates with Github
- Travis CI is free for open source projects! As well as personal projects that are public.
- It's easy to specify what command you need to run to run tests
- It's also easy to test against multiple versions of a language (python2 vs python3) and even multiple versions of libraries
- tests run automatically on branches and pull requests
- Getting set up is easy
