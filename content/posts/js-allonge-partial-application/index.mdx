## Recipes with Basic Functions

Having looked at basic pure functions and closures, we‚Äôre going to see some practical recipes that focus on the premise of functions that return functions.

## Disclaimer

The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven‚Äôt been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes. The overall use of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not.
Partial Application

In [Building Blocks](/js-allonge-building-blocks), we discussed partial application, but we didn‚Äôt write a generalized recipe for it. This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. You‚Äôll find examples in Lemonad from Michael Fogus, "Functional JavaScript" from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy "node-ap" from James Halliday.

These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic.
```js 
const callFirst = (fn, larg) =>
  function (...rest) {
    return fn.call(this, larg, ...rest);
  }

const callLast = (fn, rarg) =>
  function (...rest) {
    return fn.call(this, ...rest, rarg);
  }

const greet = (me, you) =>
  `Hello, ${you}, my name is ${me}`;
  
const heliosSaysHello = callFirst(greet, 'Helios');

heliosSaysHello('Eartha')
  //=> 'Hello, Eartha, my name is Helios'
  
const sayHelloToCeline = callLast(greet, 'Celine');

sayHelloToCeline('Eartha')
  //=> 'Hello, Celine, my name is Eartha'
``` 
As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. We‚Äôd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods.

We take it a step further, and can use gathering and spreading to allow for partial application with more than one argument:
```js 
const callLeft = (fn, ...args) =>
    (...remainingArgs) =>
      fn(...args, ...remainingArgs);

const callRight = (fn, ...args) =>
    (...remainingArgs) =>
      fn(...remainingArgs, ...args);
```
