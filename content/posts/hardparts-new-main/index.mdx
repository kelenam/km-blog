## Course Summary
In this course, you will develop an intuitive understanding of the new features of JavaScript in ES6+: iterators, generators, promises, and async/await. You'll understand how promises are implemented under-the-hood to truly help fix the challenge of inversion of control in asynchronous code design. Plus, use iterators and generators to master asynchronous control flow. Go under the hood and solve complex async challenges by using the call stack, event loop, callback queue, micro-task queue and browser APIs so that you can navigate complex asynchronous problems, easily!

2. [Promises](/hardparts-new-promises)
3. [Iterators](/hardparts-new-iterators)
4. [Generators](/hardparts-new-generators)
5. [Async / Await](/hardparts-new-async-await)

## Intro 

We will cover... 
1. Foundations of JavaScript
2. Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises)
3. Iterators 
4. Generators & async/await 


### JavaScript Code Execution 
> [^ **Any JS program need what two cores things? How are functions similar?**]Any program is going to need two things... 

- Thread of Exectuion (parsing and executing code, line after line, top to bottom)
- Live memory of variables with data (known as a Global Variable Ennvironment)

When you execute a function, it's like a mini-program, you create a new execution context compromising virtuaylly the same two things above...

- Thread of Exectuion (we go through the code in the function line by line)
- A local memory (Variable environment) where anything definedin the function is stored.
