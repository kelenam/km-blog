When you look at functions within functions in JavaScript, there‚Äôs a bit of a ‚Äúspaghetti code‚Äù look to it. The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will. There are ifs, fors, returns, everything thrown higgledy piggledy together. Although you needn‚Äôt restrict yourself to a small number of simple patterns, it can be helpful to understand the patterns so that you can structure your code around some basic building blocks.

## composition

One of the most basic of these building blocks is [**composition**]():
```js 
const cookAndEat = (food) => eat(cook(food));
``` 
>- [^ **What is composition?**]It‚Äôs really that simple: Whenever you are chaining two or more functions together, you‚Äôre composing them. You can compose them with explicit JavaScript code as we‚Äôve just done. You can also generalize composition with the B Combinator or ‚Äú**compose**‚Äù that we saw in Combinators and Decorators:
```js 
const compose = (a, b) => (c) => a(b(c));

const cookAndEat = compose(eat, cook);
``` 
>- [^ **Using composition when it applies is only 20% of the benefit, the other 80% is...**]If that was all there was to it, composition wouldn‚Äôt matter much. But like many patterns, using it when it applies is only 20% of the benefit. The other 80% comes **from organizing your code such that you can use it: Writing functions that can be composed in various ways.**

In the recipes, we‚Äôll look at a decorator called `once`: It ensures that a function can only be executed once. Thereafter, it does nothing. Once is useful for ensuring that certain side effects are not repeated. We‚Äôll also look at `maybe`: It ensures that a function does nothing if it is given nothing (like `null` or `undefined`) as an argument.

Of course, you needn‚Äôt use combinators to implement either of these ideas, you can use if statements. But `once` and `maybe` compose, so you can chain them together as you see fit:
```js
const actuallyTransfer= (from, to, amount) =>
  // do something

const invokeTransfer = once(maybe(actuallyTransfer(...)));
``` 
## partial application

>- [^ **What happens when a function takes multiple arguments?**]Another basic building block is [**partial application**](). When a function takes multiple arguments, we ‚Äúapply‚Äù the function to the arguments by evaluating it with all of the arguments, producing a value. 
>- [^ **What is partial application?**]But what if we only supply some of the arguments? In that case, we can‚Äôt get the final value, but we can get a function that represents part of our application.

Code is easier than words for this. The Underscore library provides a higher-order function called `map`. It applies another function to each element of an array, like this:
```js 
_.map([1, 2, 3], (n) => n * n)
  //=> [1, 4, 9]
``` 
We don‚Äôt want to fool around writing `_.`, so we can use it by writing:
```js
const map = _.map;
```
This code implements a partial application of the map function by applying the function `(n) => n * n` as its second argument:
```js
const squareAll = (array) => map(array,  (n) => n * n);
```
The resulting function‚Äì`squareAll`‚Äìis still the `map` function, it‚Äôs just that we‚Äôve applied one of its two arguments already. `squareAll` is nice, but why write one function every time we want to partially apply a function to a map? We can abstract this one level higher. `mapWith` takes any function as an argument and returns a partially applied map function.
```js 
const mapWith = (fn) =>
  (array) => map(array, fn);

const squareAll = mapWith((n) => n * n);

squareAll([1, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, 4, 9]
``` 
We‚Äôll discuss `mapWith` again. The important thing to see is that partial application is orthogonal to composition, and that they both work together nicely:
```js 
const safeSquareAll = mapWith(maybe((n) => n * n));

safeSquareAll([1, null, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, null, 4, 9]
``` 
We generalized composition with the compose combinator. Partial application also has a combinator, which we‚Äôll see in the partial recipe.

## Key Insights 
- composition and especially function composition helps us organize our code in a more modular format. 
- it's important to think of functions as being applied to arguments. It makes partial application make more sense if you think about it like that as oppposed to applying arguments to functions.
