Three.js is often confused with WebGL since more often than not, but not always, three.js uses WebGL to draw 3D.  
- WebGL is a very low-level system that only draws points, lines, and triangles.
- Three.js makes it much easier to create 3d instances by handling scenes, lights, shadows, materials, textures, 3d math, etc, for you.
