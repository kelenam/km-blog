We will be covering callbacks, promises, and async/await. These are all just ways of dealing [**with asynchronous data**](), when requests/actions are being done, but we don't want to wait/be blocked by those actions/requests.

Asynchronous programming is very relevant to JS, since we are often making requests to servers where it might take some time to get data back from those servers. 

Callbacks were used as the primary way of dealing with asynchronous data, until ES2015 came along with promises were introduced. 

- Promises gave us a more elegant way to handle our data.
- Then in ES7 (or so), `async`/`await` was introduced which is still dealing with promises but in a different way, we are dealing with the response in a 'synchronous-readable' way, it is visually more easy to reason about.
