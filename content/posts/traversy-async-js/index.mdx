We will be covering callbacks, promises, and async/await. These are all just ways of dealing [**with asynchronous data**](), when requests/actions are being done, but we don't want to wait/be blocked by those actions/requests.

Asynchronous programming is very relevant to JS, since we are often making requests to servers where it might take some time to get data back from those servers. 

Callbacks were used as the primary way of dealing with asynchronous data, until ES2015 came along with promises were introduced. 

- Promises gave us a more elegant way to handle our data.
- Then in ES7 (or so), `async`/`await` was introduced which is still dealing with promises but in a different way, we are dealing with the response in a 'synchronous-readable' way, it is visually more easy to reason about.
- Also going to look at `promise.all` where if you are resolving multiple promises you can call them all at the same time, and wait for each one to be done.

## Callbacks

```html:title=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Async JS</title>
</head>
<body>
        <script src="callbacks.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
Our example...
```js:title=callbacks.js
const posts = [
    { title: 'Post One', body: "This is Post One "},
    { title: 'Post Two', body: "This is Post Two "},
];


function getPosts() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let output = '';
      posts.forEach(post => {
        output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
      });
      document.body.innerHTML = output;
    }, 1000);
}


function  createPost(post, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        posts.push(post);
        callback()
    }, 2000);
}

createPost({title: 'Post Three', body: 'This is post three'}, getPosts);
```
- If we didn't pass the callback, we wouldn't repaint the DOM with our updatesd post list. We pass in `getPosts` as the callback to run after our new post is added to repaint.

## Promises
Let's keep the same code and 
```js:title=promises.js {19-29, 36}
const posts = [
    { title: 'Post One', body: "This is Post One "},
    { title: 'Post Two', body: "This is Post Two "},
];


function getPosts() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let output = '';
      posts.forEach(post => {
        output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
      });
      document.body.innerHTML = output;
    }, 1000);
}


function  createPost(post, callback) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          posts.push(post);

          let error = false;

          if (!error) {
            resolve();
          } else {
            reject('Error: something went wrong');
          }

      }, 2000);

    }) 
}

createPost({title: 'Post Three', body: 'This is post three'}).then(getPosts).catch(err => console.log(err));
```
- We are going to be modifying our createPost function to instead return a Promise.
`return new Promsie();`
- A promise takes a callback, and that callback takes two parameters:
  - resolve: successful action
  - reject: unsuccessful action

- So basically this is waiting, then setting the timeout, then it resolves, once it resolves then it will call getsPosts which we pass to `.then()`.

You can add error handling with `.catch` chained to the `.then`

You're typically going to be dealing with promises, from like axious/fetch and things, but it's good to know how to create them ourselves.

## `promise.all`
We don't want to keep chaining `.then` statements, so let's 
```js
const promise1 = Promise.resolve("hello world");
const promise2 = 10;
const promise3 =  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, 'Goodbye'));

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => console.log(values));
```
- Notice since we have a setTimeout for 2seconds the whole thing will come back as slow as the longest promise.

## Using `fetch`
We don't want to keep chaining `.then` statements, so let's 
```js
const promise1 = Promise.resolve("hello world");
const promise2 = 10;
const promise3 =  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, 'Goodbye'));

const promise4 = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').then(res => res.json());

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => console.log(values));
```
If we ran this, without `res.json()` we would wouldn't be able to read the contents of the response so we need to run two `then`s technically, the first response is the data, the second then is to map the response to json. 

## `async` / `await`
async await is just a different way to handle responses, its not like a different way to write reponses
We need the label the function as async with the `async` keyword if we we want to use await inside of it...

```js:title=async-await {37-40, 42}
const posts = [
    { title: 'Post One', body: "This is Post One "},
    { title: 'Post Two', body: "This is Post Two "},
];


function getPosts() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let output = '';
      posts.forEach(post => {
        output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
      });
      document.body.innerHTML = output;
    }, 1000);
}


function  createPost(post, callback) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          posts.push(post);

          let error = false;

          if (!error) {
            resolve();
          } else {
            reject('Error: something went wrong');
          }

      }, 2000);

    }) 
}
 
// Async / Await
async function init() {
  await createPost({title: 'Post Three': body: 'This is post three'});
  getPosts();
}

init()
```
So all we are doing is essentially now just saying, we are awaiting that `createPost` to be done until we move on and call `getPosts()`, then we just call init on line 42.

- async/await just a more elegant way to handle promises
- if we wanted to use it with `fetch` we can do that as well...

```js:title=async-await-with-fetch
async function fetchUsers() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchUsers();
```
- Now remember, the `fetch` API is a little weird, because the first promise that it returns is going to be the data unformatted, so we are going to need to call `res.json()` on that, so what we do is create another variable called `data` and set it to `await res.json()` then we can log the `data`.

## Clarifications
```js

function createPost(post) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          posts.push(post);

          let error = false;

          if (!error) {
            resolve();
          } else {
            reject('Error: something went wrong');
          }

      }, 2000);

    }) 
}

createPost({title: 'Post Three', body: 'This is post three'}).then(getPosts).catch(err => console.log(err));
```
Let's break this down....
1. We are declaring a function in global memory called `createPost`
2. We are calling create post, added to call stack with new execution context, 
  - In createPost's execution context we create in local memory label, `post` which we assign the object passed in, the post object.
  - We encounter a return statement, which is going to return us a new Promise object. Remember the 3 things new does for us: sets the this to the new object, (2) sets the proto of that object (3) returns that object. We pass in one argument and that is a callback/arrow function that gets executed (as the "executor") immediately and we active the browser API feature, `setTimeout`, which itself takes a callback, that isn't triggered until 2s later.
3. In the meantime, we chain on `.then` and push to our resolve array, the `getPosts` function and do the same with catch with a callback that will log the error.
4. After 2s, our timer is done, we push the post, to the array, declare a var error and set its value to false, if checks the error, case evaluates to true, we run the resolve function which triggers, getPosts, to be run.
