### About

#### Section 1 - Theory and Practice

`Chapter 1`, *The Importance of Good Code*, is going to talk about the negative consequences of **technical debt**, and how implementing TDD can mitigate this effect.

`Chapter 2`, *The State of JavaScript* will look at the evolution of the web application, following a **client-server model** to **single-page-applications**

`Chapter 3`: *Managing Version History with Git*

#### Section 2 - Developing our backend API

`Chapter 4`, *Setting up Development Tools*, explains the different **module formats** in JavaScript, including **CommonJS** and **ES6 Modules**. We'll also be setting up local env with tools like: nvm, yarn, babel, nodemon, and ESLint.
