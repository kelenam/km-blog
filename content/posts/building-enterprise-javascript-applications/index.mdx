#### Section 1 - Theory and Practice

`Chapter 1`, *The Importance of Good Code*, is going to talk about the negative consequences of **technical debt**, and how implementing **TDD** can mitigate this effect.

`Chapter 2`, *The State of JavaScript* will look at the evolution of the web application, following a **client-server model** to **single-page-applications**

`Chapter 3`: *Managing Version History with Git*

#### Section 2 - Developing our backend API

`Chapter 4`, *Setting up Development Tools*, explains the different **module formats** in JavaScript, including **CommonJS** and **ES6 Modules**. We'll also be setting up local env with tools like: nvm, yarn, babel, nodemon, and ESLint.

`Chapter 5`, *Writing End-to-End Tests*, hlps you practice TDD by teaching you how to write **end-to-end (E2E)** tests using **Cucumber** and **Gherkin**. We'll also migrate our API to Express as part of the refactoring step.  

`Chapter 6`, *Storing Data in Elasticsearch*, continues our TDD journey as we persist our application data onto **Elasticsearch** a *NoSQL document store and search engine*. Also writing some **Bash** scripts to help with automation.

`Chapter 7`, *Modularizing Our Code*, breaking our app into smaller modules. We will integrate a **JSON Schema** and **Ajv** inour implementation of the validation module.

`Chapter 8`, *Writing Unit/Integration Tests*, how to use **Mocha** to write unit and integration tests. We will follow a **Dependency Injection** (DI) pattern, and use **Sinon** and **spies/stubs** to mock those dependencies.

`Chapter 9` *Desiging our API*, discuss **REST** what it is and what it is not. We will also look at types of consistency: **Common**, **Local**, **Traversal**, **Domain** and **Perrennial**.

`Chapter 10`, *Deploying Your Application on a VPS*. We will use a **VPS**, configure a DNS, and use a reverse proxy and keep our Node.js process alive with **PM2**.

`Chapter 11`, *Continuous Integration*, we will implement a CI pipeline into our dev process. Also make use of Travis and Jenkins.

`Chapter 12`, *Security: Authentication and Authorization*, we will look at passwords, sessions, token-based authentication. These include cryptographic hashing, salts, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

`Chapter 13`, *Documenting our API*, completes the development of our API by documenting it using Swagger. Learn to write OpenAPI-compliant specs in YAML, and visuzalize them using Swagger UI.

#### Section 3 - Developing our frontend UI

`Chapter 14`, *Creating UI with React*, going over React, VDom, pure components, and JSX. Also look at module bundlers, like Webpack, Rollup, and SystemJS.

`Chapter 15`, *E2E Testing in React*, implement a TDD workflow involving Cucumber, and Selenium and using headless browers. We will also implement client-side routing in our app.

`Chapter 16`, *Managing States with Redux*, using Redux to manage state in our application.

#### Section 4 - Infrastructure and automation

`Chapter 17`, *Migrating to Docker*, migrates our application to run Docker containers. Control groups, namespaces, Dockerfiles, and docker images.

`Chapter 18`, *Robust Infrastructure with Kubernetes*, deploys our app into a cluster using Kubernetes, a **cluster management tool**, and combines discovery services, global config stores, schedulers and load balancers.

#### Section 5 - Important JavaScript concepts and Syntax

`Chapter 19`, *Important Concepts in JavaScript*, primer on fundamental principles of JS, things like data types, prototypes, the prototype inheritance chain, classes, context, and the execution context.

`Chapter 20`, *Writing in ECMAScript2015+*, newer features of JS, defaults, destructuring, assignment, rest and spread operators, template literals, and promises.
