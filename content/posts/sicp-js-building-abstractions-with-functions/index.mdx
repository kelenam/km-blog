- We are about to study the idea of [**computational process**], that is, abstract beings that inhabit computers.
- As they evolve, *processes* manipulate other abstract things called [**data**]().
- A pattern of rules that directs the evolution of a process is referred to as a [**program**]().
- People create programs to direct processes.

Similarity between programming and spell-casting/conjuring.

Master software engineers can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance.
- Good programs are well structured, easily debuggable, and modular.

## Programming in JavaScript
- A bit of history: Brendan Eich (Netscape), designed for controlling behavior of WWW browsers. 
- Orinally named "Mocha" --> LiveScript --> JavaScript (trademark of Orackle)

- JS is now a general-purpose programming language.
- A [**JavaScript Interpreter**]() is a machine that carries out processes described in the JS language.
- JS inherited some things from Scheme and Lisp (the OG language of this book)
    - From Scheme, JS inherited its most fundamental design principles such as *statically-scoped first-class functions and dynamic typing*.

- JavaScript programs were initially interpreted by web browsers. The popularity of JavaScript for controlling web browsers gave rise to a standardization effort, culminating in *ECMAScript*.

The practice of embedding JavaScript programs in web pages encouraged the developers of web browsers to implement JavaScript interpreters. As these programs became more complex, the interpreters became more efficient in executing them, eventually using sophisticated implementation techniques such as [**Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**]().
