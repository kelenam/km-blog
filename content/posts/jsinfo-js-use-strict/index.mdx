> "use strict" at the top of the file was the directive introduced in ES5 (2009) as a way to keep old code working while simultaneously alleviating some of the the imperfect decisions initially cast into the language. 

### Ensure that “use strict” is at the top
Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.

Strict mode isn’t enabled here:
```js 
alert("some code");
// "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top

"use strict";

// strict mode is not activated
```
- Only comments may appear above "use strict".
- No way to cancel `"use strict"`

## In Browsers
- Most modern browsers have "use strict" on by default 
- If not available in your browswer you can always wrap your code in an IIFE with 'use strict'; as the first line in the function.

## Always “use strict”
We have yet to cover the differences between strict mode and the “default” mode.

In the next chapters, as we learn language features, we’ll note the differences between the strict and default modes. Luckily, there aren’t many and they actually make our lives better.

For now, it’s enough to know about it in general:

>1. The "use strict" directive switches the engine to the “modern” mode, changing the behavior of some built-in features. We’ll see the details later in the tutorial.
2. Strict mode is enabled by placing "use strict" at the top of a script or function. Several language features, like “classes” and “modules”, enable strict mode automatically.
3. Strict mode is supported by all modern browsers.
4. We recommended always starting scripts with "use strict". All examples in this tutorial assume strict mode unless (very rarely) specified otherwise.
