## Summary Questions
1. When would we want to use 


The two most used data structures in JavaScript are `Object` and `Array`
- **Objects** allow us to create a single entity that stores items by key
- **Arrays** allow us to gather data items into an ordered collection.

> **But when we pass those objects or arrays to a function, it may not need an object/array as a whole, but rather individual pieces.**

[***Destructuring assignment***]() is a special syntax that allows us to "unpack" arrays or objects into a bunch of variables.  

Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on.

## Array destructuring
```js 
// we have an array with the name and surname
let arr = ["Ilya", "Kantor"];

// destructuring assignment
// sets firstName = arr[0]
// and surname = arr[1]
let [firstName, surname] = arr;

alert(firstName); //---> Ilya
alert(surname); //---> Kantor
```
