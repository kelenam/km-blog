This is just going to be a collection of useful tidbits from random resources regarding VSCode.

## Navigation
- My favorite recent, I feel silly for not knowing this sooner is move by word, `CTRL + arrow keys`, mostly left and right for progressing / regressing through words, up and down will just move the page not the cursor. But this is super handy and this was something I really missed in VIM.

 
## Unrelated
This isn't really related to VSCode, but rather, VIM. Something I came across in VIM, if you `C - s` in Vim, it locks, the answer is XON/XOFF, flow control. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/72086/ctrl-s-hang-terminal-emulator

The fix is `C - q` to disable.
