## The Cascade
The "C" in CSS.
- Fundamentally CSS is about declaring rules: that is, under various conditions, we want certain things to happen.
* Key part of CSS development vomes down to writing rules in such a way that they are predictable.
- First step towards this is understanding how the rules we write are applied.

Rulesets can target the same element, how they get resolved depends on how the rules are defined.
>- [^ **What is the cascasde?**]The ***cascade*** is the name for this set of rules.

>- [^ **The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets, what are they?**]The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets:
>   1. ***stylesheet origin***: Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser's default styles.
>   2. ***selector specificity***: Which selectors take precedence over which.
>   3. ***Source order***: Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.

```
                                      No                     No                     No
Conflicting ------> Different Origin-----> Is one an inline-------> Do selectors --------> Use declaration 
declarations          or importance?       style? (Scope)           have Different         that comes later
                             |                  |                    specificity?           in source order.
                             |                  |                         |                       
                             | Yes              | Yes                     | Yes                   
                             v                  v                         v                       
                    Use declaration with     Use inline                Use declaration
                      higher-priority        declaration               with higher 
                          origin                                       specificity
```

#### A quick review of terminology
- [***declaration***](), a css statement, e.g. `color: black` it's made up of a *property* and a *value*.
- [***declaration block***]() a group of declarations inside curly braces compromise what is known as a declaration block.

Together, the *selector* and the *declaration block* are called a [***ruleset***](). A ruleset is also called a *rule*, but ruleset seems preferred nomenclature.

- [***at-rules***]() are language constructs beginning with an "at" symbol, e.g. `@import`.

### Understanding stylesheet origin
>- [^ **What are two common example of style sheet origins?**]There are different types of *origins* of stylesheets.
- *user agent styles* are the browsers default styles
- styles you write are called *author* styles which have greater priority.
- after *user agents styles* are considered, the browser applied your styles - the *author styles*, this allows declarations you specify to **override** those set by the user agent.

#### Important declarations
- An [**important declaration**]() can be specified by adding `!important` to the end of the declaration, before the semicolon:
```css
color: red !important;
```
- Declarations marked `!important` are treated as highter-priority orign, so the overall order of preference, in decreasing order, is this:
1. Author important
2. Author
3. User agent

### Understanding specificity 
>* If conflicting declarations can't be resolve based on their origin, the browser next tries to resolve them by looking at their *specificity*.

>* The browser evaluatese specificity in two parts:   
>   1. styles applied inline in the HTML  
>   2. styles applied using a selctor.  

#### Inline styles
[**Inline styles**](): if you use an HTML `style` attribute, to apply styles. The declarations are applied only to that element, they are in effect "scoped" declarations, which override any declarations applied from your stylesheet or a `<style>` tag.

>* [^ **How do you override inline declarations in your stylesheets? What if the inline styles are marked `!important`?**]To override inline declarations in your stylesheets, you'll need to add an `!important` to the declaration, shifting it into a higher-priorty origin. If the inline styles are marked important, then nothing can override them.

#### Selector specificity
The second part of specificity is determined by the selectors. For instance, a selctor with two class names has a higher specificity than a selector with one.

In our ongoing example if we said something like...
```css 
#main-nav a {
  color: white;
  background-color: #13a414; /* Teal background color */
}

.featured {
  background-color: orange; /* Teal background color */
}
```
- An ID selector has a higher specificity than a class selector.
- [^ **A _type selctor_ is also known as a?**]Similarly, a class selector has a higher specificy than a tag selector (also called a [**type selector**]())

#### Rules of specificity
>- If a selector has more IDS, it wins (that is, it's more specific)
- If that results in a tie, the selector with the most classes wins 
- If that results in a tie, the selector with the most tag names wins.

#### Pseudo-class selector Specificity 
- [^ **What specificity do pseudo-class selectors have? What about things like `*` and `>, +, -`?**]Pseudo-class selectors (for example, `:hover`) and attribute selectors (for example, `[type="input"]`) each have the same specificity as a class selector. The universal selector (`*`) and combinators (`>,+,-`) have no effect on specificity.
- [^ **If you add a declaration to your CSS and it seems to have no effect, often it's because**]... a more specific rule is overriding it.

#### Specificity Notation 
A common way to indicate specificity is in a number form, often with commas between each number. FOr example, "1,2,2" indicates a specificity of one ID, two classes, and two tags.
- 2,0,0 would be two IDS 
- 0,0,2 would be two tags 
- Now you can simply compare numbers,
- Occassionally people use four-number notation, 1,0,0,0, Where the 1 would be inline-style specificity.

### Understanding source order
The third and final step to resolving the cascase is [**source order**](). If the origin and the specificity are the the same, then the declaration that appears later in the stylesheet--or appears in a stylesheet included llater on the page--takes precedence.

#### Link Styles and Source Order
- Link styling should obey a certain order, that's  because source order affects the cascade. This listing shows styles for links on a page in the "correct order"
```css 
a:link {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: red;
}
```
- The cascade is the reason this order matters: given the same specificity, later styles override earlier styles. 
>- [^ **What is the hepful mnemonic to remember ordering link styles?**]A helpful mnemonic to remember this order is **LoVe/HAte**--link, visited, hover, active. Note that if you change one of the selectors to have different specificity than the others, this will break down and you may get unexpected results.

#### Cascaded Values 
>- [^ **The browser follows what three steps in determing cascade values?**]The browswer follows these threwe steps--**origin**, **specificity**, and **source order** to resolve every property for every element on the page. A declaration that "wins" the cascade is called a **cascaded value**.
- [**cascaded value**](): A value for a particular property applied to an element as a result of the cascade 
- If a property is never specified for an element, it has no cascaded value for that property. 

### Two rules of thumb
>- [^ **What are the two rules of thumb when working with the cascade?**]The two common rules of thumb for working with the cascade: 
  1. **Don't use IDs in your selector**
  2. **Don't use `!important`**

These two rules can be good advice, but don't cling to them forever. There are exceptiosn where they can be okay, but never use them as a knee-jerk reaction to win a specificity battle.

## Inheritance
There's one last way that an element ca receive styles--*inheritance*. The cascade is frequentllky conflated with the concept of inheritance. They are related, but different. 

- If an element has no cascaded value for a given proeprty, it may inhert one from an ancestor element. e.g. common to apply a `font-family` to the body element.
- Not all properties are inherited. By default, only certain ones are. 
  - In general, these are properties you'll want to be inherited. 
  - They are primaryily properties pertain to text, e.g. `color`, `font`, `font-family`, etc.
  - A few others inherit as well, such as the list properties: `list-style`, `list-style-type`, etc.
- Inherited properties are passed down the DOM tree from parent nodes to their descendants.

### Use your DevTools!
- DevTools provide visibility into exactly which rules are applying to which elements and why.
  - strike-through styles are *overriden values*.
  - cascaded values are the ones without a strik-through
  - inherited values are listed as such 
>- ‚≠ê The style inspector shows every selector targeting the inspected element, ordered by specificity. Below that are all inherited properties.
  - You can type in the Filter box at the top to hide all but a certain set of declarations 
  
## Special values
There are two special values that you can apply to any property to help manipulate the cascade: `inherit` and `initial`.

### Using the `inherit` keyword
Sometimes you'll want inheritance to take place when a cascade value is preventing it. To do this you can use the keyword `inherit`. **You can override another value with this, and it will cause the element to inherit that value from its parent.**.

https://codepen.io/kelena_mori/pen/dyYzzaz

Add this footer to our exmaple.
```html 
<footer class="footer">
  &copy; 2016 Wombat Coffee Roasters &mdash;
  <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of use</a>
</footer>
```
- typically, you'll have a font color set for all links on the page (and if you don't, the user agent styles sets one), and that color is applied to to the Terms of Use link as well.
- To make the link in the footer gray, you'll need to override it...
```css 
a:link {
  color: blue; /* Global link color the page */
}
.footer {
  color: #666; /*footer color set to gray */
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 15px 0;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 14px;
}

.footer a {
  color: inherit; /* inherits font color from the footer */
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
- Here the third ruleset overrides the blue link color by inheriting it color from its parent
- The benefit here is that the footer link will change along with the rest of the footer should anything alter.
- You can also use the `inherit` keyword to force inheritance of a property not normally inherited, such as border or padding.

### Using the `initial` keyword
- Sometimes you'll find you have styled applied to an element that you want to undo. 
- Every CSS property has an initial value or default 
- If you assign the value `initial` to that property, then it effectively resets to its default value.
  - Note: May not be compatibile with < IE11
- The benefit of `initial` is that you don't have to think about it as much. If you want to remove a border from an element, set `border: initial`. If you want to restore an element to its default width: `width: initial`
  - You may be in the habit of using the value `auto` to do this sort of reset, in fact you could do `width: auto` to get the same effect, but its only because the default value of `width` IS `auto`.
  - `auto` however, is not the default value for all properties, which is why `initial` might be a safer bet.
- Note: `display: initial` will result in `display: inline` no matter the element, that's because the default value for `display` itself is `inline` regardless of whatever type of element it is being applied to.

## Shorthand properties
- [^ **What are shorthand properties? What is an example of one?**][**shorthand properties**]() are proeprties that let you set the values of several other properties at one time.
  - e.g. `font` is a shorthand property that represents several font properties: `font-style`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family`,
- shorthand properties are useful for keeping your code succinct and clear, but a few quirks about them arent' readily apparent.

### Beware shorthands silently overriding other styles
- Most shorthand properties let you omit certain values and only specify the bits you're concerned with.
- However, doing this still sets the omitted values, e.g. `font` property for a page title without specifying a `font-weight` a font-weight of `normal` would still be set.

#### `font` is the worst offender for overwrites 
- `font` is the most egregious for causing problems , because it sets such a wide array of properties. For this reasons, I avoid using it except to set general styles on the `<body>` element.

### Understanding the order of shorthand values
- Shorthand properties try to be lenient, e,.g. `border: 1px solid black` == `border: black 1px solid` because the browser can understand which values you intend. 
- Most shorthands however, need a specific order: Top, Right, Bottom, Left.
- shorthand properties for padding and margin for example, for these properties, the values are in clockwise order, beginning at the top.
> - ‚≠ê Remembering this order can keep you out of trouble. In fact, the word _TRouBLe_ is an mnemonic you can use to remember the order: Top, Right, Bottom, Left. 

#### TRBL properties also support truncated notations 
- If the declaration ends before one of the four sides is given a value, that side takes its value from the opposite side. 
  - Specify three values: and the left and right side will both use the second one
  - Specifiy two values and the top and bottom will use the first one.
  -  If you specify one values, it will apply  to all four sides. 
>- For many developers, the most problematic of these is when three values are given. Remember, this specifies the top, right, and bottom. Because no left valeu is given, it will take the same value as the right; the second value will be applied to both the left and the right sides.
- Most often you'll use two values wher the first is Top/Bottom and the second value is Left/Right.
  - More often then note you will have more padding on the sides than on the top and bottom of things, buttons for instance.

### Horizontal, Vertical 
- The _TRouBLe_ mneomonic only applies to properties that apply individually to all four sides of the box.
- Other properties only support up to two values.
  - e.g. `background-position`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow` 
    - Anything you could imagine on a Cartesian grid.
  - They work inversely to trouble, that is, horizontal right/left values first, followed by vertical top/bottom values.
  - That is because these properties represent a Cartesian grid where coordinates are given (x,y)
  - `box-shadow:  10px 2px #5f9090;     /* Shadow offset 10px to the right and 2px down */`

> If you're working with a property that specifies two measurements from a corner, think "Cartesian grid". If you're working with one that specifies measurements for each sdie all the way around an element, think "clock". 

## Summary 
- Keep selector specificity under control 
- Don't confuse cascade with inheritance 
- Certain properties are inherited, including those for text, lists, and table borders.
- Don't confuse `initial` with `auto` values 
- Stay out of _TRouBLe_ with shorthand

## Key Insights

- The difference between inheritance and the cascade
  - It's common to apply your `font-family` to the body element and let inheritance take care of the rest.
