## Summary Questions
1. The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets, what are they? 
1. What are two common example of style sheet origins?

1. How do you override inline declarations in your stylesheets? What if the inline styles are marked `!important`?

## The Cascade
The "C" in CSS.
- Fundamentally CSS is about declaring rules: that is, under various conditions, we want certain things to happen.
* Key part of CSS development vomes down to writing rules in such a way that they are predictable.
- First step towards this is understanding how the rules we write are applied.

Rulesets can target the same element, how they get resolved depends on how the rules are defined.
The ***cascade*** is the name for this set of rules.

> The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets:

> 1. ***stylesheet origin***: Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser's default styles.
> 2. ***selector specificity***: Which selectors take precedence over which.
> 3. ***Source order***: Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.

Conflicting ------> Different Origin-----> Is one an inline-------> Do selectors --------> Use declaration

                             |                  |                         |                       
                             | Yes              | Yes                     | Yes                   
                             v                  v                         v                       
                    Use declaration with     Use inline                Use declaration
                      higher-priority        declaration               with higher 
                          origin                                       specificity
```

#### A quick review of terminology
- [***declaration***](), a css statement, e.g. `color: black` it's made up of a *property* and a *value*.
- [***declaration block***]() a group of declarations inside curly braces compromise what is known as a declaration block.

Together, the *selector* and the *declaration block* are called a [***ruleset***](). A ruleset is also called a *rule*, but ruleset seems preferred nomenclature.

- [***at-rules***]() are language constructs beginning with an "at" symbol, e.g. `@import`.

### Understanding stylesheet origin
- There are different types of *origins* of stylesheets.
- *user agent styles* are the browsers default styles
- styles you write are called *author* styles which have greater priority.
- after *user agents styles* are considered, the browser applied your styles - the *author styles*, this allows declarations you specify to **override** those set by the user agent.

#### Important declarations
- An [***important declaration***]() can be specified by adding `!important` to the end of the declaration, before the semicolon:
```css
color: red !important;
```
- Declarations marked `!important` are treated as highter-priority orign, so the overall order of preference, in decreasing order, is this:
1. Author important
2. Author
3. User agent

### Understanding specificity 
>* If conflicting declarations can't be resolve based on their origin, the browser next tries to resolve them by looking at their *specificity*.

>* The browser evaluatese specificity in two parts:   
>   1. styles applied inline in the HTML  
>   2. styles applied using a selctor.  

[**Inline styles**](): if you use an HTML `style` attribute, to apply styles. The declarations are applied only to that element, they are in effect "scoped" declarations, which override any declarations applied from your stylesheet or a `<style>` tag.

>* To override inline declarations in your stylesheets, you'll need to add an `!important` to the declaration, shifting it into a higher-priorty origin. If the inline styles are marked important, then nothing can override them.

#### Selector specificity
The second part of specificity is determined by the selectors. For instance, a selctor with two class names has a higher specificity than a selector with one.

### Understanding source order

### Two rules of thumb

## Inheritance
## Special values
### Using the `inherit` keyword
### Using the `initial` keyword
## Shorthand properties
### Beware shorthands silently overriding other styles
### Understanding the order of shorthand values
