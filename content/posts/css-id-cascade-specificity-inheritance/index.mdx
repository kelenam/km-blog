## Review Questions
1. The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets, what are they? 

## The Cascade
The "C" in CSS.
- Fundamentally CSS is about declaring rules: that is, under various conditions, we want certain things to happen.
* Key part of CSS development vomes down to writing rules in such a way that they are predictable.
- First step towards this is understanding how the rules we write are applied.

Rulesets can target the same element, how they get resolved depends on how the rules are defined.
The ***cascade*** is the name for this set of rules.

The cascade considers three things to resolve potentially conflicting rulesets:

1. ***stylesheet origin***- Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser's default styles.
2. ***selector specificity***-Which selectors take precedence over which.
3. ***Source order***-Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.

Conflicting ----------> Different Origin-----> Is one an inline-------> Do selectors --------> Use declaration 
declarations              or importance?       style? (Scope)           have Different         that comes later

                                 |                  |                         |                       
                                 | Yes              | Yes                     | Yes                   
                                 v                  v                         v                       
                        Use declaration with     Use inline                Use declaration
                          higher-priority        declaration               with higher 
                              origin                                       specificity
```

### A quick review of terminology
- [***declaration***](), a css statement, e.g. `color: black` it's made up of a *property* and a *value*.
- [***declaration block***]() a group of declarations inside curly braces compromise what is known as a declaration block.

Together, the *selector* and the *declaration block* are called a [***ruleset**](). A [***ruleset**]() is also called a *rule*, but ruleset seems preferred nomenclature.

- [***at-rules***]() are language constructs beginning with an "at" symbol, e.g. `@import`.


### Understanding stylesheet origin
- There are different types of *origins* of stylesheets.
- *user agent styles* are the browswers default styles
- styles you write are called *author* styles which have greater priority.
