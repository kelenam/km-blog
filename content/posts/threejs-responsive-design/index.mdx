## Summary Questions
1. In the web platform of Three.js what is the recommended way to set the size of something?
1. When we are resizing our canvas with CSS what are the two problems we may encounter?
1. How would we go about correcting for the first issue we may encounter when resizing via CSS?
4. Why would it be important to write a function to check the canvas size?
5. Why do you want to pass `false` at the end of `renderer.setSize`?


## Intro
In the fundamentals example, we used `<canvas id="c"></canvas>`, a plain canvas with no CSS and no size.
- That canvas defaults to `300x150` CSS pixels in size.

>* In the web platform, the recommended way to set the size of something is to use CSS.
```css 
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 100%;
}
#c {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: block;
}
```
In HTML the body has a margin of 5 pixels by default so setting the `margin` to `0` removes the margin. Setting the `html` and `body` `height` to `100%` makes them fill the window. Otherwise they are only as large as the content that fills them.

Next we tell the `id=c` element to be `100%` the size of its container which in this case is the body of the document.

Finally we set its `display` mode to `block`. A canvas's default display mode is inline. Inline elements can end up adding whitespace to what is displayed. By setting the canvas to `block` that issue goes away.

- You can see the canvas is now filling the page but there are 2 problems
    1. our cubes are stretched
    2. they are blurry

### Fixing strechy problem first
The fix is setting the aspect of the camera to the aspect of the canva's size. 
>* We can do that by looking at the `canvas.clientWidth` and `canvas.clientHeight` properties.

We'll update the render loop like this:
```js
function render(time) {
    time *= 0.001;

    const canvas = render.domElement;
    camera.aspect = canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight;
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
}
```

### Fixing the blockiness
- Canvas elements have two sizes. One size is the size the canvas is displayed on the page. That's what we set with CSS.
- The other size is the number of pixels in the canvas itself.
- This is no different than an image. e.g. we have a 128x64px image and using CSS we might display as 400x200 pixels...
```html
<img src="some128x64image.jpg" style="width:400px; height:200px">
```
- A canvas's internal size, it's resolution, is often called it [**drawingbuffer size**]().
- In three.js we can call the canvas's *drawingbuffer* size by calling `renderer.setSize`

**What size should we pick?**    
The most obvious answer is "the same size the canvas is displayed". Again, to do that we can look at the canvas's `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` properties.

Let's write a function that checks if the renderer's canvas is not already the size it is being dislayed as and if so set it size...
```js
function resizeRendererToDisplaySize(renderer) {
    const canvas = renderer.domElement;
    const width = canvas.clientWidth;
    const height = canvas.clientHeight;
    const needResize = canvas.width !== width || canvas.height !== height;
    if (needResize) {
        renderer.setSize(width, height, false);
    }
    return needResize;
}
```
The reason we might want to write a function to check the canvas size is...  
>* **Resizing the canvas is an interesting part of the canvas spec and it's best not to set the same size if it's already the size we want.**[^4]

>* **It's important to pass `false` at the end. `render.setSize` by default sets the canvas's CSS size but doing so is not what we want. We want the browser to continue to work how it does for all other elements which is to use CSS to determine the display size of the element. We don't want canvases used by three to be different than other elements.**[^5]

Note that our function returns `true` if the canvas was resized. We can use this to check if there are other things we should update. Let's modify our render loop to use the new function

```js
function render(time) {
  time *= 0.001;
 
  if (resizeRendererToDisplaySize(renderer)) {
    const canvas = renderer.domElement;
    camera.aspect = canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight;
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  }
 
//...
```
To make the point about letting CSS handle the resizing let's take our code and put it in a separate .js file. You can see the HTML & CSS dictates the rules of the canvas, and we didn't have to change any code in our Three.js file. This speaks to Summary Question #5.

## Handling HD-DPI displays
[**HD-DPI**]() stands for high-density dot per inch displays.

The way this works in the browser is they use CSS pixels to set the sizes which are supposed to be the same regardless of how high res the display is. The browser will just render text with more detail but the same physical size.

There are various ways to handle HD-DPI with three.js. 
First is to do nothing, the second is a resolution multiplier and auto pass in a value (not recommended), the third is too do it manually when you resize.

### Summary Answers.
1. By using CSS.
1. (a) Are objects may be stretched/warped looking (b) They can appear pixeled/boxy
1. By selecting the canvas with `renderer.domElement` and binding it to a constant that we can call it's `.clientWidth` divided by its `.clientHeight` properties on then update the camera by calling the camera's `updateProjectionMatrix()` function.
