## Summary Questions
1. In the web platform of Three.js what is the recommended way to set the size of something?
1. When we are resizing our canvas with CSS what are the two problems we may encounter?
1. How would we go about correcting for the first issue we may encounter when resizing via CSS?

## Intro
In the fundamentals example, we used `<canvas id="c"></canvas>`, a plain canvas with no CSS and no size.
- That canvas defaults to 300x150 CSS pixels in size.

>* In the web platform, the recommended way to set the size of something is to use CSS.
```CSS
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 100%;
}
#c {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: block;
}
```
In HTML the body has a margin of 5 pixels by default so setting the `margin` to `0` removes the margin. Setting the `html` and `body` `height` to `100%` makes them fill the window. Otherwise they are only as large as the content that fills them.

Next we tell the `id=`c element to be `100%` the size of its container which in this case is the body of the document.

Finally we set its `display` mode to `block`. A canvas's default display mode is inl`ine. Inline elements can end up adding whitespace to what is displayed. By setting the canvas to `block` that issue goes away.

- You can see the canvas is now filling the page but there are 2 problems
    1. our cubes are stretched
    2. they are blurry

### Fixing strechy problem first
The fix is setting the aspect of the camera to the aspect of the canva's size. 
>* We can do that by looking at the `canvas.clientWidth` and `canvas.clientHeight` properties.

We'll update the render loop like this:
```js
function render(time) {
    time *= 0.001;

    const canvas = render.domElement;
    camera.aspect = canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight;
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
}
```

### Fixing the blockiness
- Canvas elements have two sizes. One size is the size the canvas is displayed on the page. That's what we set with CSS.
- The other size is the number of pixels in the canvas itself.
- This is no different than an image. e.g. we have a 128x64px image and using CSS we might display as 400x200 pixels...
```html
<img src="some128x64image.jpg" style="width:400px; height:200px">
```
- A canvas's internal size 

### Summary Answers.
1. By using CSS.
1. (a) Are objects may be stretched/warped looking (b) They can appear pixeled/boxy
1. By selecting the canvas with `renderer.domElement` and binding it to a constant that we can call it's `.clientWidth` divided by its `.clientHeight` properties on then update the camera by calling the camera's `updateProjectionMatrix()` function.
