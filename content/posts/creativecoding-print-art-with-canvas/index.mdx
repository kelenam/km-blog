## Installing canvas-sketch-cli
- Make sure you have the right version of Node and NPM

Then use the command `npm install canvas-sketch-cli --global` to install it globally.

Easiest way to test if its been installed successfully, is to mkdir a new empty dir, move into folder in terminal then type, `canvas-sketch [filename] --new --open` this will scaffold out a new project and open it.
- this opens the browser, creates the file, and creates the package.json
