## What is Sass?
- Stands for (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)
- CSS PreProcess / Extension
- Let's you use features that do not exist in CSS
- Sass (`.scss`) files are compiled to regular CSS
    - browswer doesn't read `scss` files, needs to be compiled down
    - can use live-sass-compiler extension in vscode

### `.sass` vs. `.scss`
- scss files are backwards compat with regular CSS (the one we stick with)
- sass has space indentation for sepeartors, no curly braces

### Variables in CSS
- regular CSS now has variables they are called custom properties, however the syntax isn't very pretty, Sass allows 
us to use variables in a more readable way:
```scss 
$font-stack: Helveticca, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
}
```
- Prefixed with `$`
- `$primary-color: blue`
- Easier to read and write than CSS custom properties

### Nesting
One of the main reasons to use CSS over CSS.
- Allows you to nest child selectors within the parents curly braces, and these children only pertain as children of the parent 

### Modules / Partials
- Can break up your files into separate files, without making multiple http requests to separate css files
- Imports in Sass are handled entirely during compilation
- this allows you to break up your files into components or pages
    - using a `_` underscore it, Sass will ignore it during compilation, but still allows you to use it in other files.

```scss:title=_base.scss 
// _base.scss
$font-stack: Helveticca, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
}
```
We can import the base file into the styles file 
```scss:title=styles.scss 
@use 'base';

.inverse {
    background-color: base.$primary-color;
    color: white;
}
```

### Mixins & Functions
- Elevates CSS to something closer to a programming language
- Gives you the ability to pass things in as parameters/properties...

```scss
@mixin transform($property) {
    -webkit-transform: $property;
    -ms-transform: $property;
    transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg));}
```
Now whenever you want to use this transform you just include the mixin without having to write the same 3 lines in your css every time you want to use the transform...

Versus in css...
```css
.box {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
    transform: rotate(30deg);
}
```
- Functions work in a similar way in that they actually return something, where as a **mixin** is just placing the css there, also with functions you don't have to the `@include`.

### Inheritance
We can extend styles from other base styles...
```scss 
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
    color: #333;
}

.message {
    @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: green;
}

.error {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: red;
}

.warning {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: yellow;
}
```
- makes it easier to create families of styles and extend functionality when more specific use case required.


### Operators
You can do calculations on things. Traversy doesn't use this too much.  
`width: 400px / 905px * 100%;`

### Conditionals
You can have logic, if/else statements... etc.
- uses `@if` and `@else`
