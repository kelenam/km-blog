## What is Sass?
>[^ **What is Sass?**]- Stands for (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)
- CSS PreProcess / Extension
- Let's you use features that do not exist in CSS
- Sass (`.scss`) files are compiled to regular CSS
    - browswer doesn't read `scss` files, needs to be compiled down
    - can use live-sass-compiler extension in vscode

### `.sass` vs. `.scss`
> [^ **What is the difference between `.sass` files and `.scss` files, which do we prefer?**]- scss files are backwards compatible with regular CSS (the one we stick with)
- sass has space indentation for sepeartors, no curly braces
- My preference is for using `scss` as its more comprehensible to fellow devs not familiar with sass.

### Variables in CSS
- regular CSS now has variables they are called **custom properties**, however the syntax isn't very pretty, Sass allows 
us to use variables in a more readable way:
```scss 
$font-stack: Helveticca, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
}
```
[^ **How do you define variables in Sass? What are the benefits of using them?**]-Sass variables are prefixed with `$`
- `$primary-color: blue`
- Easier to read and write than CSS custom properties

### Nesting
One of the main reasons to use CSS over CSS.
[^ **What is another great feature of sass when it comes to parent/child classes**]- Sass allows you to nest. Sass allows you to nest child selectors within the parents curly braces, and these children only pertain as children of the parent 

### Modules / Partials
[^ **How would you go about keeping seprate files in Sass? What are the benefits of this?**]- Can break up your files into separate files, without making multiple http requests to separate css files
- Imports in Sass are handled entirely during compilation
- this allows you to break up your files into components or pages
    - using a `_` underscore it, Sass will ignore it during compilation, but still allows you to use it in other files.

```scss:title=_base.scss 
// _base.scss
$font-stack: Helveticca, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
}
```
We can import the base file into the styles file 
```scss:title=styles.scss 
@use 'base';

.inverse {
    background-color: base.$primary-color;
    color: white;
}
```

### Mixins & Functions

> [^ **What do mixins and functions give us in Sass? What is a mixin?**]-[Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin): Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.
- Elevates CSS to something closer to a programming language
- Gives you the ability to pass things in as parameters/properties...

```scss
@mixin transform($property) {
    -webkit-transform: $property;
    -ms-transform: $property;
    transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg));}
```
Now whenever you want to use this transform you just include the mixin without having to write the same 3 lines in your css every time you want to use the transform...

Versus in css...
```css
.box {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
    transform: rotate(30deg);
}
```
> [^ **What is the primary difference between mixins and functions?**]- Functions work in a similar way in that they actually return something, where as a **mixin** is just placing the css there, also with functions you don't have to use the `@include`.

### Inheritance
We can extend styles from other base styles...
```scss 
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
    color: #333;
}

.message {
    @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: green;
}

.error {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: red;
}

.warning {
    @extend %message-shared;
    border-color: yellow;
}
```
> -[] makes it easier to create families of styles and extend functionality when more specific use case required.

### Operators
You can do calculations on things. Traversy doesn't use this too much.  
`width: 400px / 905px * 100%;`

### Conditionals
You can have logic, if/else statements... etc.
- uses `@if` and `@else`

## Let's get Started
Starting with a regular html file...
To get started let's create a new folder called `scss`, in this folder we will create a file called `style.scss`

- Any styles we can set into a variable.

### Compiling your Sass
Two ways, the first is going to be the npm route, the second with Vscode 
1. `sudo npm i -g sass`
    - From here you do `sass -watch scss/style.scss css/style.css`
    - this will produce two files the output and the source/map map file (not really used)
    - don't ever edit your css file directly.
2. Vscode: live sass compiler 
    - Now there is a watch sass button on the button of our editor 

> [^ **How would you change how/where your sass->css dirctories/files are compiled?**] Ctrl+, for keyboard shortcut for settings, then go to `live-sass` or search it and edit the settings.json file.
In our live-sass vscode settings we are using compresssed as the format (minified), and setting where we handle the extension and the save path. You could have a /dist/ folder if you want,
```json 
"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
    {
        "format": "compressed",
        // "extensionName": ".min.css",
        "savePath": "/dist/css"
    }
],
"liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false,
```

### Our styles 
```scss
$light-color: #f4f4f4;
$font-stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #0E6cff;
$secondary-color: #ff8700;

* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

body {
    background-color: $light-color;
    font-family: $font-stack;
    line-height: 1.6;
}

img {
    width: 100%;
}

a {
    text-decoration: none;
}

.showcase {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    color: #fff;
    height: 600px;
    /* going to nest the nav here to only pertain to nav */
    nav {
        display: flex;
        align-items: cewnter;
        justify-content: space-between;

        ul {
            display: flex;
            list-style: none;
        }

        li {
            padding: 15px;
        }

        a:hover {
            color: $secondary-color;
        }
    }

    a {
        color: #fff;
    }

    /* the & is the name of the parent */
    /* .showcase-content === &-content */
    &-content {
        height: 100%;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;

        img {
            width: 50%;
        }

        h1 {
            font-size: 50px;
            line-height: 1.2;
        }

        p {
            margin: 20px 0;
        }
    }

}

.container {
    /*we want to push everything to the middle*/
    /*going to be on the root level, since you*/
    /*might want to use this somewhere else*/
    /*as a possible utility class */
    max-width: 1100px;
    padding: 0 30px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    overflow: auto;
}
```
### Breaking up our files with *partials*
It's a good pratice to separte your config files, things that would contain mixins, variables, functions whatever into their own file
```scss:title=_config.scss
$light-color: #f4f4f4;
$font-stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #0E6cff;
$secondary-color: #ff8700;
```

```scss:title=main.scss 
@import 'config';
```
> [^ **What is a partial? How do you import one from another file?**]- This isn't going to get compiled to a css file because the underscore tells Sass this is a partial. A [**partial**]() is just to be brought into another file, it's not to be compiled on its own.

Now, in our "main" or more primary file we can just say `@import 'config';` to bring in our partial file. We don't have to say dot or underscore or anything.

This is one of the big advantages of using Sass, is that we have this kind of central place for theming and breaking things up in separate classes.

We can do the same thing with utilities styles, like our container style for example, buttons would be another utility.

### buttons 
- Creating a partial for buttons, here we can use inheritance, because with buttons, a lot of the times we will have the same shared base styles, but just have different colors or borders.

```scss:title=_buttons.scss
%btn {
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 8px 20px;
    margin: 3px;

    &:hover {
        transform: scale(.98);
    }

    .btn-primary {
        @extend %btn;
        background-color: $primary-color;
    }
    .btn-secondary {
        @extend %btn;
        background-color: $secondary-color;
    }
}
```
- You can extend classes and ids, you don't have use the % syntax.
- Now we want to extend that btn with our primary and secondary buttons, we do so with the `extend` keyword 
- We can still use our variables, b/c remember this all gets compiled into one file.
- As per the [docs](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-7), it seems like the `%` just represents styles to be extended, if they are never extended they are never applied.


### ligten/darken functions
> We can use the functions, `lighten([color], [percentage])` and `darken()` lighen and darken element by a certain percentage...

```scss
.btn-primary {
    @extend %btn;
    background-color: lighten($primary-color, 10);
}
``` 

### Functions/Conditionals
Lets write a function that detects background color, and makes the text color based on the lightness of the background. This is going to be a function so we can keep it in our `_config.scss` file.
```scss:title=functions&conditionals 
```
- The parameter is going to be a variable so it needs the `$` sign. This param is just going to be the bg color we pass in,
- we are using ligtness, and seeing if its lighter than 70 then we can do a return

```scss:title=_config.scss {8-15}
$light-color: #f4f4f4;
$font-stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
//$primary-color: #0E6cff;
$primary-color: #e0ffff;

$secondary-color: #ff8700;

// Set text color based on bg color
@function set-text-color($color) {
    @if (lightness($color) > 70) {
        @return #333;
    } @else {
        @return #fff; 
    }
}

```
Now over in our style.scss file we can modify the showcase text color to use this function.
`.showcase { ... color: set-text-color($primary-color); ... }`

### Mixins 
- Our mixin is like a function but it doesn't actually return anything, it lets use cute down on reusable code, by specifying snippets saved in one place.

```scss:title=_config.scss {17-21}
$light-color: #f4f4f4;
$font-stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
//$primary-color: #0E6cff;
$primary-color: #e0ffff;

$secondary-color: #ff8700;

// Set text color based on bg color
@function set-text-color($color) {
    @if (lightness($color) > 70) {
        @return #333;
    } @else {
        @return #fff; 
    }
}

// set background & text color 
@mixin set-background($color) {
    background-color: $color;
    color: set-text-color($color)
}
```
Now that we have our mixin, we can just replace the code in showcase....
```scss:title=style.scss {2}
.showcase {
    /*background-color: $primary-color; */
    /*color: set-background-color($primary-color); */
    /* the above is replaced with the mixin below */
    @incluce set-background($primary-color);
    height: 600px;
    /* ... */
}
```
- To use the mixin we use the `@include` keyword.

### Applying our mixin to buttons
In _buttons.scss, we can just include our mixin.
```scss:title=_buttons.scss
/* ... */
.btn-primary {
    @extend %btn;
    /* background-color: lighten($primary-color, 10); */
    @include set-background(lighten($primary-color, 10));
}
.btn-secondary {
    @extend %btn;
    /* background-color: $secondary-color; */
    @include set-background($secondary-color);
}
```
It's still white because we set the `a` tag to be white in our main styles.

Now we can go ahead and change the primary color back to the blue. So now, if we had something that changed the theme to be a light bg color, the text color will be set dynamically.

### Loops
If we wanted to have our margins or padding be settable by classes, something akin to how Materialize, Bootstrap, wor Tailwind handles it, saying things like `py-1` or `m-1`, we can recreate this using loops.
- we wouldn't be doing this for a small project but if we had a larger project this might be more useful.

Let's create a new variable, and set it to a new list....
```scss
$spaceamounts: (1,2,3,4,5);

@each $space in $spaceamounts {
    .m-#{space} {
        margin: #{$space}rem;
    }
    .my-#{space} {
        margin: #{$space}rem 0;
    }
    .p-#{space} {
        padding: #{$space}rem;
    }
    .py-#{space} {
        padding: #{$space}rem 0;
    }
}
```
- A list is set with parens, ()
- to iterate over we use `@each`
- just like a JS for...in loop 
- going to loop through and give us access to each of these numbers, refered to by the label `$space`
- the way we access each iteration in the @each loop is with `#{}`, kind of like a JS template literal.
- we set the property we we want, and give it spacing corresponding with rems.

Might be better suited in the utilities file since these are utility classes 

### Mobile Responsive
We can create a new file called `_mobile.scss`
```scss:title=_mobile.scss
@media(max-width:700px) {
    .showcase {
        height: 400px;

        &-content {
            text-align: cewnter;

            img {
                display: none;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- We also then `@import` this at the bottom of our file where we normally put our media queries, wherever you put this is where ever it will show up in the compiled css.
- maybe even just have everything but the config file at the bottom.

Note: We don't include the scss file in our production builds.

## Clarifications
- I'm not too sure where you would use the `@use` instead of `@import`
    - The docs says [this](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use
    ): The @use rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. Stylesheets loaded by @use are called "modules". Sass also provides built-in modules full of useful functions.
