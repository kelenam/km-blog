## `pipeLog`
`pipeLog` is a function that logs a value and returns it.

Use the `console.log` to log the supplied value, combined with the `||` operator to return it.

```js
const pipeLog = data => console.log(data) || data;

// Examples
pipeLog(1);
// logs 1 and returns 1 
```

## Thoughts
This works because `console.log` itself returns `undefined`, since we are using it primarily for it's side effect of logging something to the console. The `or` operator defaults to the returning the data since this is an arrow function with one line.
