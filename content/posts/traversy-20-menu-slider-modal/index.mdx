## HTML 
1. Title My Landing Page, link our style and script 
2. Link font awesome cdn: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.13.0/css/fontawesome.min.css
3. In our body, we are going to have our nav tag 
  - within nav we want a div with a class of logo
    - img tag within logo with random user.me api, so https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/76.jpg
  - under logo we will have ul  
    - in ul an li with an a tag with empty hrefs: Home
    - The same li/a for Portfolio, Blog, Contact
    - Thats it for the nav
4. Have a header tag under the nav  
  - we need a button to toggle the menu so tag of button with id and class of `toggle`
    - within button we will have an image from font awesome: `i.fa.fa-bars.fa-2x` (font awesome we can double size of icon with  fa-2x)
5. Below button we will have, our h1 called My Landing Page
6. ‚≠ê Below that a p tag with 10 words of lorem, we get that in Emmet by saying `lorem10`.
7. still within header, but below `p` tag we will create a button with a class callled `cta-btn` and an id of `open`. We will use this id to basically hide/show the modal. The text in the button will be `Sign Up`. 
8. Next will be the main body/class or container. So a div with a class of container. 
9. An h2 with : What is this landing page about?
10. p tag, with lorem30,
11. another p tag with lorem20
12. still within container div, put h2: Tell me more
13. another lorem tag with lorem40
14. below that another h2 with "Benefits"
15. An ul with three li tags: Lifetime Access, 30 day money back, tailored customer support
16. Then another p with lorem70.
17. Last thing we need is the modal. Can be outside of our container since it will have a fixed position. div with class `modal-container` and id of `modal`. Basically the container is going to the bg of our modal with the faded out bg, and the box in the middle will be the actual modal 
18. In the modal container a new div with class `modal`
  - in this modal a button with class close-btn and id of close 
    - in this button we will use a fontawesome icon: `i.fa.fa-times
  - Below button will be a div with class `modal-header`
    - will have an h3 that says: Sign Up
  - Under header will be a div with class `modal-content`
    - in here a p tag with: "Register with us to get  offers, support and more"
    - form with class `modal-form`
      - in form there will be a div, no class,
        - in this div there will be a label for name
        - an input with id of `name`, and placeholder: "Enter name"
        - Copy this div, with label/input tags, and paste it 3 times, and change name to email, password and confirm password, with id of password2. 
    - Under this last div we need our submit button: `input:submit`, value will be `Submit`, and class will be `submit-btn`

## Navbar Styling 
- Going to grab Lato from google fonts: `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato&display=swap');`
- Set variables: 
  - modal-duration: 1s,
  - primary color 30336b
  - secondary color be2edd
- `*` bx 
- `body` font-family: to Lato
