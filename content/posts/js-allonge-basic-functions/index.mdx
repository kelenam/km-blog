**In JavaScript, functions are values**, but they are also much more than simple numbers, strings, or even complex data structures like trees or maps. **Functions represent computations to be performed.**
```js 
() => 0
``` 

This is a function that is applied to no values and returns `0`. Let’s verify that our function is a value like all others:
```js 
(() => 0)
  //=> [Function]
``` 
>- [^ ⭐**What is our rule for checking if an expression is also a value?**]⭐What!? Why didn’t it type back` () => 0` for us? *This seems to break our rule that if an expression is also a value, JavaScript will give the same value back to us. What’s going on?* The simplest and easiest answer is that although the JavaScript interpreter does indeed return that value, displaying it on the screen is a slightly different matter. `[Function]` is a choice made by the people who wrote Node.js, the JavaScript environment that hosts the JavaScript REPL. If you try the same thing in a browser, you may see something else.

## functions and identities
You recall that we have two types of values with respect to identity: **Value types** and **reference types**. Value types share the same identity if they have the same contents. Reference types do not.

Which kind are functions? Let’s try them out and see. For reasons of appeasing the JavaScript parser, we’ll enclose our functions in parentheses:
```js 
(() => 0) === (() => 0)
  //=> false
``` 
- **Like arrays, every time you evaluate an expression to produce a function, you get a new function that is not identical to any other function, even if you use the same expression to generate it**. 
- “Function” is a reference type.

## applying functions
Let’s put functions to work. The way we use functions is to *apply* them to zero or more values called **arguments**. Just as `2 + 2` produces a value (in this case 4), applying a function to zero or more arguments produces a value as well.

Here’s how we apply a function to some values in JavaScript: Let’s say that `fn_expr` is an expression that when evaluated, produces a function. Let’s call the arguments args. Here’s how to apply a function to some arguments:

`fn_expr(args)`

Right now, we only know about one such expression: `() => 0`, so let’s use it. We’ll put it in parentheses  to keep the parser happy, like we did above: `(() => 0)`. Since we aren’t giving it any arguments, we’ll simply write `()` after the expression. So we write:

```js 
(() => 0)()
//=> 0
```

## functions that return values and evaluate expressions
We’ve seen `() => 0`. We know that `(() => 0)()` returns `0`, and this is unsurprising. Likewise, the following all ought to be obvious:

```js 
(() => 1)()
  //=> 1
(() => "Hello, JavaScript")()
  //=> "Hello, JavaScript"
(() => Infinity)()
  //=> Infinity
``` 
Well, the last one’s a doozy, but still, the general idea is this: **We can make a function that returns a value by putting the value to the right of the arrow**.

In the prelude, we looked at expressions. Values like `0` are expressions, as are things like `40 + 2`. Can we put an expression to the right of the arrow?
```js 
(() => 1 + 1)()
  //=> 2
(() => "Hello, " + "JavaScript")()
  //=> "Hello, JavaScript"
(() => Infinity * Infinity)()
  //=> Infinity
```
Yes we can. We can put any expression to the right of the arrow. For example, `(() => 0)()` is an expression. Can we put it to the right of an arrow, like this: `() => (() => 0)()`?

Let’s try it:
```js 
(() => (() => 0)())()
//=> 0
``` 
Yes we can! **Functions can return the value of evaluating another function**.

When dealing with expressions that have a lot of the same characters (like parentheses), you may find it helpful to format the code to make things stand out. So we can also write:
```js 
(() =>
    (() => 0
      )()
  )()
  //=> 0
```
It evaluates to the same thing, `0`.

## commas
>- [^ **What is the comma seperator and what does it do?**]The [**comma operator**]() in JavaScript is interesting. It takes two arguments, evaluates them both, and itself evaluates to the value of the right-hand argument. In other words:
```js 
(1, 2)
  //=> 2

(1 + 1, 2 + 2)
  //=> 4
``` 
We can use commas with functions to create functions that evaluate multiple expressions:
```js 
(() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))()
  //=> 4
``` 

>- [^ **When might the comma separator be useful?**]This is useful when trying to do things that might involve side-effects, but we’ll get to that later. In most cases, JavaScript does not care whether things are separated by spaces, tabs, or line breaks. So we can also write:

```js 
() =>
  (1 + 1, 2 + 2)
```
Or even:
```js 
() => (
    1 + 1,
    2 + 2
  )
``` 

## the simplest possible block
There’s another thing we can put to the right of an arrow, a block. A [**block**]() has zero or more statements, separated by semicolons. 

So, this is a valid function:
```js 
() => {}
```

It returns the result of evaluating a block that has no statements. What would that be? Let’s try it:
```js 
(() => {})()
  //=> undefined
```
What is this `undefined`?

## `undefined`
> In JavaScript, the absence of a value is written [**`undefined`**](), and it means there is no value. It will crop up again. undefined is its own type of value, and it acts like a value type:

```js 
undefined
  //=> undefined
``` 
Like numbers, booleans and strings, JavaScript can print out the value `undefined`.
```js 
undefined === undefined
  //=> true
(() => {})() === (() => {})()
  //=> true
(() => {})() === undefined
  //=> true
``` 
> No matter how you evaluate `undefined`, you get an identical value back. `undefined` is a value that means “I don’t have a value.” But it’s still a value.

> You might think that `undefined` in JavaScript is equivalent to `NULL` in SQL. No. In SQL, two things that are NULL are not equal to nor share the same identity, because two unknowns can’t be equal. In JavaScript, every `undefined` is identical to every other `undefined`.

## `void`
We’ve seen that JavaScript represents an undefined value by typing `undefined`, and we’ve generated `undefined` values in two ways:

>[^ **What are the three ways to evaluate a value as `undefined`?**]1. By evaluating a function that doesn’t return a value `(() => {})()`, and;
2. By writing `undefined` ourselves.
3. By using the `void` operator, `void 0`

There’s a third way, with JavaScript’s `void` operator. Behold:
```js 
void 0
  //=> undefined
void 1
  //=> undefined
void (2 + 2)
  //=> undefined
```
>- [^ **What is `void`? When would we use it and what is the convention when using it?**]`void` is an operator that takes any value and evaluates to `undefined`, always. So, when we deliberately want an `undefined` value, should we use the first, second, or third form? The answer is, use void. By convention, use `void 0.`

>- [^ **Why would we use the `void` operator over the other methods to produce an `undefined` value?**]The first form works but it’s cumbersome. The second form works most of the time, but it is possible to break it by reassigning undefined to a different value, something we’ll discuss in Reassignment and Mutation. **The third form is guaranteed to always work, so that’s what we will use.**

## back on the block
Back to our function. We evaluated this:
```js 
(() => {})()
  //=> undefined
``` 
>- [^ **Again, what is a block?**]We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a [**block**](), and we said that a block is a (possibly empty) list of JavaScript statements separated by semicolons. 

Something like: { statement1; statement2; statement3; ... ; statementN }

We haven’t discussed these statements. What’s a **statement**?

>- [^ **What is a statement?**]There are many kinds of JavaScript statements, but the first kind is one we’ve already met. **An expression is a JavaScript statement**. Although they aren’t very practical, these are valid JavaScript functions, and they return `undefined` when applied:
```js
() => { 2 + 2 }
() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 }
```

As we saw with commas above, we can rearrange these functions onto multiple lines when we feel its more readable that way:
```js
() => {
    1 + 1;
    2 + 2
  }
```

But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to `undefined`:
```js
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
  //=> undefined
  
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
  //=> undefined
  
(() => {
    1 + 1;
    2 + 2
  })()
  //=> undefined
```

As you can see, a block with one expression does not behave like an expression, and a block with more than one expression does not behave like an expression constructed with the comma operator:

```js
(() => 2 + 2)()
  //=> 4
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
  //=> undefined
  
(() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))()
  //=> 4
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
  //=> undefined
```

So how do we get a function that evaluates a block to return a value when applied? With the `return` keyword and any expression:
```js 
(() => { return 0 })()
  //=> 0
  
(() => { return 1 })()
  //=> 1
  
(() => { return 'Hello ' + 'World' })()
  // 'Hello World'
``` 
>- [^ **What does the `return` keyword do?**]The `return` keyword creates a **return statement** that immediately terminates the function application and returns the result of evaluating its expression. For example:
```js 
(() => {
    1 + 1;
    return 2 + 2
  })()
  //=> 4
```
And also:
```js 
(() => {
    return 1 + 1;
    2 + 2
  })()
  //=> 2 
``` 
The `return` statement is the first statement we’ve seen, and it behaves differently than an expression. For example, you can’t use one as the expression in a simple function, because it isn’t an expression:
```js 
(() => return 0)()
  //=> ERROR
``` 
>- [^ ⭐**Statements belong only inside... Why is JS different than other languages when it comes to treatment of statements? What are so examples of statements in JS?**]⭐**Statements belong inside blocks and only inside blocks**. Some languages simplify this by making everything an expression, but JavaScript maintains this distinction, so when learning JavaScript we also learn about statements like function declarations, for loops, if statements, and so forth. We’ll see a few more of these later.

## functions that evaluate to functions
>- [^ **Can we put an expression that evaluates to a function on the right side of a function expression?**]If an expression that evaluates to a function is, well, an expression, and if a return statement can have any expression on its right side… Can we put an expression that evaluates to a function on the right side of a function expression?

Yes:
```js 
() => () => 0
``` 
That’s a function! It’s a *function that when applied, evaluates to a function that when applied, evaluates to 0*. So we have a function, that returns a function, that returns zero. Likewise:
```js 
() => () => true
``` 
That’s a function, that returns a function, that returns `true`:
```js 
(() => () => true)()()
  //=> true
``` 
We could, of course, do the same thing with a block if we wanted:
```js 
() => () => { return true; }
``` 
But we generally don’t.

## Key Insights 
- You can't use a statement when an expression is required, for instance, an arrow function not making use of a block expects an expression, not a statement, so you can't say `() => return 'something'`. This would create a syntaxError.
- **Statements belong inside blocks and only inside blocks**. 
  - e.g. function declarations, for loops, if statements, and so forth.
