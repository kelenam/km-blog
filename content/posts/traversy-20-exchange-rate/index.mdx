## HTML 
- Just want to bring in the header image
- An h1 
- p tag giving instructions to select currency
- Then a select then a bunch of options/ 
    - just grab the options from the existing repo
- For the inputs `<input type="number" id="amount-one" placeholder="0" value="1">` 

- In between the two currency classes is going to be a div with a class of `swap-rate-container`
    - it will hold a button with a class btn and an id of rate. The inner text will be Swap
    - Below that button will be an empty div with a class and id of `rate`. Nothing will go in here, it will just be generated dynamically.

- This should be it for the HTML.
