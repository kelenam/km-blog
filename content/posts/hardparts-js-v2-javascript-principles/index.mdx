## Summary Questions
1. In this line, `const ouput = multiplyBy2(num)`, what is the value of `output` prior to the execution of `multiplyBy2(num)`?
1. When JS code runs, it does what two things, or depends on what two things?
1. What is the [**call stack**]()?
1. What are the three core components of JavaScript?

## Thread of Execution
When JS code runs, it does two things:
1. Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/'executes' each line -known as the [**thread of execution**]()
1. Saves 'data' like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its [**memory**](), the fancy name for the place that we store data.

- We can even save code ('functions');

```js {1,2,7}
const num = 3;
function multiplyBy2 (inputNumber) {
    const result = inputNumber*2;
    return result;
}

const output - multiplyBy2(num);
const newOutput = multipleBy2(10);
```
Walking through the code above:          
**Line 1:** defining a constant called `num` and assigning it the value `3`   
**Line 2**: Defining the function `multiplyBy2` and storing all of its code bundling it up and storing it in memory with the identifier `multiplyBy2`.   
**Line 7**: Defining a constant called `output` and storing the output of `multipleBy2` function we are about to call.

- on **Line 2**, there are two parts of a function declaration, there's our identifier, the label for something we are storing in the computer's memory, the identifier here is `multiplyBy2`. That means the thread of execution continues to line 7.
- on **Line 7**, we are storing a function call. It's a command, where we can only store values, that's fixed final things, I can't store some "go do some work instruction". So for now, `output` will remain uninitalized, this is in contrast to the old days where it's `undefined` because again, if we are declaring a `const` ouptut and storing `undefined` we wouldn't be able to change it out with the value that returns from the function so we say its' not really even fully stored yet, it's unitialized.

- Running a function is like a mini app, itself has...
- Two parts to executing code: line by line (thread of execution) and a place to store (memory) any functions, variables, constants, etc. These two things combined are referred to as a brand new [***Execution Context***]()...

## Functions 
Code we save ('define') functions & can use (call/inboke/execute/run) later with the function's name/identifier + `()`

### Execution Context
- A [***Execution Context***]() is created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts:  
    1. Thread of execution
    1. Memory 

So before we move on to any more lines of code (still on line 7) we need to create a brand new execution context within our global one (as soon as we start running our file of code, we create what's called a ***global execution context*** for running all the code in the file; the main program).

When we create a function we are creating a 'mini' program.
Again, this mini program has ( you ca visualize it on the left) memory, a place to store things. We call it [***local memory***]() because its just stuff available in the function context. 

```js {2-5,7}
const num = 3;
function multiplyBy2 (inputNumber) {
    const result = inputNumber*2;
    return result;
}

const output - multiplyBy2(num);
const newOutput = multipleBy2(10);
```
Whenever we run code in a function, the first thing we always handle is it's arguments/params. Here we have `inputNUmber`
- Our ***parameter*** acts as the ***label/identifier*** for the piece of data that gets assigned the value of the ***argument*** we are passing into that function. When we are calling the function on Line 7 we are passing that function the value `3`, that has an identifier of `num`. So we are essentially saying, in the...
    - local memory of the new execution context, create a variable (under the hood it's using let/var) named `inputNumber` and give it the value `3`.
    - `inputNumber` is the ***parameter***, `3` is the ***argument***.
- Then we create a new constant called `result` that gets assigned the value `3` * `2` which is `6`, so it gets assigned the value `6`.
- The final line in the function is `return result`
    - JS looks up, in local memory first, what `result` is and finds the value `6`
    - Then `return` takes that number and 'returns it', shoots it back out to where it was called.
    - What is happeneing is that the we are evaluating that function block and resolving it to a value. That function evaluates into the number `6` which becomes the values of the assignment `output`: 

- We only have one thread of execution running at any given time. JS is single threaded.

- **Line 8**: we are declaring a new constant called `newOuput` and similarly to `output` we don't immediately assign it anything, because we must create a new execution context to run `multiplyBy2` with the argument `10`. It runs, completes the above and finally gets assigned the value `20` into that global label `newOutput`.

## Call Stack
Let's talk about the thread of execution that wove in and out, we knew that the invocation of our function was going to come back out to global. How? (visually we can kind of see), but JS has to have a way to do so.

>* JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running by using something called the [**callstatck**]()

### Call Stack
The [**call stack**] is...
- A way for JavaScript to keep track of what function is currently running. (where's the thread of exeuction). 
- Run a function - add to call stack
- Finish running the function - JS removes it from the call stack
- Whatever is on top of the call stack 
    - that's the function we're currently running.
    - thats the key rule of a stack, only engaged with one thing at a time, that's the top-most thing.

As soon as we finish running a function on the callstack, it 
- The `return` keyword is the keyword responsible for telling us that function is "done", that its execution context is no longer need and it can be popped off the call stack.

So once our `multyipleBy2` function finishes running, what will be the new "top" of the stack?
- Well always, on the bottom of our stack is our global execution context
    - all our globally labeled stuff
    - global is always there, we always return back to the `global()`
- Once we hit our next function, we add it to the top of the call stack. Once that's done, it just goes back to global.
- If we had nested functions, or recursive functions, those would keep be adding to the top of our call stack. The function returns to where it started running that function in the first place.

### The Three Core Components of JavaScript
1. Our memory to store data as we go through the code line by line
1. Thread of Execution to go through the code line by line (sometimes storing data, but also, taking some of the stored functionality code and start running it, like functions that we then run, creating new execution contexts, local data stored until completion, only data that is saved is data saved outside of the function or data that is returned. Because everything inside the functional call goes away upon completion of the function)
1. We keep track of the functions we're running, where our thread of exeuction is, by using our **call stack**.

## Summary Answers
1. It's not assigned a value, it's kind of just in limbo, waiting for its assignment from the return of its function call. That's because if we were to say it were `undefined` prior to completion of `multipleBy2` we wouldn't be able to change it's value as its been declared as a constant.
1. Thread of Execution (going through code line by line) and Memory (a place to store data).
1. The way for JS to keep track of what functions it is and needs to run.
1. The three core components of JS are:
    1. Memory - a place to store data
    2. Thread of Execution - going through data/code line by line
    3. Call Stack - keeping track of the thread of execution we are on.
