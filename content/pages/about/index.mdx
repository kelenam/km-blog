Hi!

### Want to start your own Zettelkasten?
Here are a few resources that turned me on to the concept of the Zettlekasten. While technically, I suppose this blog isn't quite a Zettelkasten (for numerous reasons), it still makes use of a flat structure in the blog list page, tags, and backlinks to reference other articles. I've kind of mixed some theories/practicies of others to come up with something that works for me.
